Doing my normal research, I check out everyone's reviews and view photos. What I've gathered from all that was: 1) expect a long wait unless you go a bit earlier than lunch or dinner time. 2) possibly expect to sit\/share a table with a group you do not know 3) order chargrilled oysters and raw oysters. I did just that. \n\nWe arrived at 11:50am and waited less than 5 minutes and chatted with the lovely woman in charge of regulating the line. The bf and I asked her what she would order and she recommended: chargrilled, seafood platter and most definitely the craw puppies. \n\nWe were walked through to be seated in the back by such a nice host (sorry I didn't catch your name, but it was today 10.25.18 at 11:50am). He asked us if we dined there before and gave us his suggestions, told us the soup of the day was corn and crab bisque and told us Helen would be taking care of us. \n\nHelen, a super sweet woman that took great care of us! As I am very particular with my love for soup, I asked Helen if there was any way I could just sample the soup and she found a way :) In the mean time I ordered a dozen chargrilled, half dozen raw and the craw puppies. She came back with my bisque taster and I asked for a bowl. \n\nChargrilled: so buttery, garlicky and cheesy. My bf loves them because he's not a huge fan of raw.. they were so yummy, except they really shrunk in size due to cooking it. The bread that came with it to dip with the saucy goodness, felt slightly toasted and warm. \n\nRaw: so yum! Fresh and didn't taste that fishy taste. Tasted very clean. Came with lemon and cocktail sauce, I love mine with just lemon or plain. \n\nCraw puppies: comes in a set of 6 with tarter sauce. So very yummy and stuffed with crawfish and some filler. I liked it plain. \n\nWe were still a bit hungry so Helen recommended the peacemaker. Although I couldn't find this sandwich on the top 10 to see what the other sandwiches are, it was pretty good. At this point we were very full but managed to pull through and eat the fried oysters and shrimp in the nice soft French bread. \n\nRecommended in order:\nRaw, chargrilled, craw puppies, peacemaker","date":1540525100000}

Of all the places to eat in my 8 day stay in NOLA (combined work and play :) ) this is my favorite - as every dish we ordered was prepared perfectly and was memorable in taste.  We opted to line up during the 11 am lunch as dinner lines can literally be a half block long each night.\n\nWe came here as a combined brunch, so we ordered very many dishes to scope out their menu.\n\nThe chargrilled oysters are must haves - it turned my wife into a fan, and she normally doesn't like oysters.  Definitely get it by the dozen and not half dozen since they are addictive.  There's a bit of cheese baked into each half shell - this surprisingly gives the grilled oysters a shot of flavor, along with the lemon wedges they provide.  I saw Acme had a wall of fame board for people who downed fifteen dozen!\n\nWe shared 2 lbs of boiled crawfish at market prices.  Excellent spicy flavor - supposedly you can extract meat from the heads and claws too.\n\nNext came a bowl of seafood gumbo, with a thick, dark spicy and salty roux.  It had perfectly cooked rice in the center and was surrounded by chunks of shrimp, oyster, and smaller pieces of crab.  Probably one of the better gumbos we've had in NOLA.\n\nI got the seafood \u00e9touff\u00e9e with the side of fried crawfish tales.  The dish was presented like the gumbo, but had a more distinct tomatoe-peppery soup base.  The crawfish tails were fried perfectly and not greasy at all!\n\nMy wife ordered their famous oyster po-boy sandwich - I think it was called Peace Maker or something, and it was one of their signature dishes.  It was a huge French roll with layers of lettuce, fried oyster, tomatoe, and this amazing Tabasco-mayo dressing which cut through everything and literally kicked up the flavor.  Biting through this sandwich also gave an amazing contrast in texture in addition to flavor.  If you tell them that you'll be sharing, they will split the sandwich for you into two separate plates.\n\nFor dessert (needed an excuse to stay a bit longer since a rain storm started outside) we got the bread pudding with ice cream and whiskey sauce.  It was delicious, and combined elements of cold ice cream with warm bread pudding in a sweet-bitter combination.\n\nOverall a resounding success of a restaurant.  We plan to line up again during our last day in NOLA before flying home.  It's so rare for a restaurant to execute so well on so many dishes.

After only 15 minutes waiting in line on a Friday night, J and I were able to get a seat at the oyster bar - this was great because the guys who shuck the oysters like to have a grand ole time chatting up the out-of-owners. \n\nThe restaurant was divey and dimly lit from the neon ACME sign out front painting the room a jazzy red. We ordered the below:\n\nDozen raw oysters ($14) freshly shucked. These were great - they are juicy and plump. Not briney like some of LI oysters and not overly oceany like some of the west coast ones I've had. They were creamy but the didn't overpower your palette. \n\nDozen grilled oysters ($20) - these were grilled with parmesean cheese and breadcrumbs. They were good but I liked Cochon's wood-fired ones better (possibly because too much Food Network has told me dairy and seafood don't mix?).\n\nShrimp Etouffe ($9) - this was the first time I have had etouffe and maybe I am just not a fan of etouffe in general but the dish was very medicore. There were quite a few baby shrimp in the dish but the flavor just wasn't there and the roux was too thin.\n\nSoft-shell crab for 2 ($23) - thick battered giant soft shell crab - just how the south likes it. The soft shell grab was yummy but I am very picky about my fry batter and this was just a tad too thick and thought it could have been seasoned better. It had a good crunch though.\n\nWe left full, and happy but the 4 beers and alcoholic smoothie from Bourbon could have been a factor.","date":1401390884000}

ALTHOUGH my seat gave a better view of this lady's cleavage that was sitting at the counter... thanks\n\nCOURSE ONE\n\nOur waiter (and quite the upbeat server) immediately recommended the same dish that our friends had already recommended... he suggested an order of 6 but Marisol has \"BIG EYES\" and \"NEEDED\" an order of 12... \n\nI saw more than one order of these pass our table over the next 15 minutes and every single time I felt like Pavlov's dog (salivating like leaky faucet)... finally ours arrived and it looked delicious... \n\n* * * BASED ON LOOKS * * * it was exactly as I expected and exactly as it was described on the menu.... \"sizzling, chargrilled oysters saturated in a herb butter sauce, topped with a special blend of cheese.  Served with french bread slices\"\n\n* * * BASED ON TASTE * * * it was really good and dipping the french bread into the herb butter was superb (not healthy but superb).  The only \"issue\" I had with the dish was I wish it was grilled a hair less because most of the cheese was burnt to the point where it adhered itself to the oyster shell so each bite only got a small bit of the cheese... wish it was a bit more runny (or at a minimum grilled just enough to melt the cheese).\n \nDRINK COURSE \n\nWe also decided to order a couple drinks too... \n\n* * * GLASS SERVING * * * so Marisol ordered a \"Prickly Pear Mojito\" (Bacardi rum, prickly pear syrup, mint leaves and a couple limes to garnish the drink)... personally I don't typically order Mojitos (even though I LOVE them) unless I'm at a cuban restaurant or a place that specializes in them because even though it's a simple drink most places screw them up... well, thumbs up to Acme for doing this one well.\n\n* * * PLASTIC * * * why the \"F\" would you serve me a plastic cup when our other drink was served in glass;  I mean, we're not at a dive bar and it's not nickel beer night at some college bar... and considering I ordered a \"Swedish Mule\" (Moscow Mule with Swedish vodka)... come on, any mule should be in a copper mug and if those are unavailable or the restaurant just doesn't have them, then at least serve the drink in glass... a \"F'n\" plastic cup!\n\nI will point out though that both drinks were very reasonably priced (both under 8 dollars)\n\nCOURSE TWO\n\nWe were hungry but not starving enough to go to another restaurant to order entrees, so we decided to stay put and order a couple things to share... \n\n* * * CUP OF SEAFOOD GUMBO * * * it had the rice but didn't really notice much in the way of shrimp and crab but the flavor was there... decent but not special by any means.\n\n* * * FRIED PEACE MAKER PO' BOY * * * basically it's a traditional Po' Boy with fried shrimp and fried oysters plus lettuce, tomato and pickles and topped off with Tabasco infused mayo... the menu makes claim of it being the \"No. 4 in Top Ten Sandwiches\"... where that's from, I have no clue but they do make the claim; somewhat ironic to make the claim but no source... but moving on I will say that the Po' Boy was just like the Seafood Gumbo... decent but not special by any means.\n\nNOTHING TO DO WITH THIS EATERY\n\nHi Gina (BOOBS)...

We were out there on line for over an hour (from light in the sky to stars shining bright).  But I am so glad we stuck it out stubbornly (we didn't feel like moving anymore).  It's near Bourbon St so it'll get loud, but the people that were on line with us were adorable (the ones behind us were in the late 50s, maybe even into their 60s, but they were just darling; there was another guy, late 50s probably, that kept answering to every name the hostess calls out).  The place is extremely crowded, so you can imagine the service and the noise.  The waitress was nice enough to tell us that we were ordering too much food for our small party (nice of her to stop us from bankrupting our wallets), but she did get a few of our orders wrong (understandable with how crazy the place got). \n\nWe ordered: \n1. Raw Oysters: slimy and delicious, the best combo lmao! First timer trying raw oysters and I was glad that this was the place that took that cherry. ;)\n2. Chargrilled Oysters: friends ordered this plate for the non-raw oyster consumers (guilty as charged here).  I loved it! I fought for my share (would've fought to take other's shares, but I'm too nice for that). The smokey taste didn't overpower the oyster at all surprisingly.\n3. New Orleans Medley (sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice and grilled smoked sausage): well, the place is known for its oysters, let's make that known, after all \"oyster house\" is tacked onto its name.  This dish wasn't bad, but they oysters definitely outshined everything else.\n4. Craw Puppies: hey, the name sounded cute! And we figured it'd be similar to hush puppies....it wasn't.\n5. Fried Seafood Platter (Oysters, Shrimp and Fried Fish): the fish was the main star of this dish; crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth center, exactly how fried fish should be.  \n6. Acme Special Po-Boy (Hot debris-style roast beef, ham, turkey, American & Swiss cheese): this was where our breaking point was.  We just couldn't eat it during that sitting, we were too stuffed from all the prior dishes so we ended up taking it to go.  I ate it for breakfast the next day, so I can't really give a review because the taste had probably changed by then (it became extremely salty, to the point where I finished a bottle of water after eating my quarter of the sandwich).\n\nOverall, definitely a must go, must wait, must eat type of place.

We each tried two and then asked the waiter if we could have some new oysters less cooked. The manager came over with the tray of oysters and started rudely debating the degree of doneness.

Must be a me problem? Luckily, we went at an off time and only waited in line about 3 minutes before we were seated at the bar.\n\nStarted with the Boo Fries (poutine-esque, with gravy and cheddar cheese). They were tasty, but the overwhelming flavor was salty and texture was mushy.\n\nNext up was the soup of the day, crab and corn chowder. The cup was just that, a small cup. Apparently the everything-is-bigger-in-America mentality has not seeped its way into Acme. Fine by me. Again...reasonably tasty, but it was super sweet, like it had a goodly amount of sugar, which was weird. I get that crab+corn=sweetish, but this was beyond reasonable.\n\nThe crab cake was fine. Big enough to share, Not super flavorful, but with a horseradish sauce drizzled on top.\n\nThe Fried Peace Maker Po-boy.was highlighted on the menu as being ranked #4 out of the top 10 sandwiches....somewhere, by someone, so I went for it. Fried oysters and shrimp, some shredded lettucs, tomato, pickles, Tabasco mayo on French bread. Again, tasted primarily salty. I think it needed more mayo? I doused it in Tabasco and it was fine. The bread was really good (soft and a little crusty on the outside), but there was too much of it.\n\nService was a bit strange. Not rude, but certainly not warm. \n\nI wanted hole-in-the-wall, but got more of a chain-y feel. I'll try to do better tomorrow!","date":1394192521000}

We actually have a table for you by the window.\"\n\nAnd THAT was the start of one of the most memorable meals of my 2014 NOLA trip.

I've never been so happy to be in a party of two.\n\nBelieve the hype, you guys. Those chargrilled suckers are delicious - we ordered a dozen for each of us and they arrived at a reasonable amount of time with the garlic butter and Parmesan cheese still bubbling and popping. We also ordered the meat pies, which were good, but I think my boyfriend liked them more than I did.

That being said, after 5 days of delicious food, the group consensus was that this is a good introduction to New Orleans cuisine, but there are so many non-touristy food places to explore! On the plus side, the line was randomly short when we arrived and our group of 6 was accommodated relatively quickly. I'd also really like to highlight the Chargrilled Oysters here, they were definitely the star of the meal. A few of us in the group (myself included), were not too keen on oysters before arriving in NOLA and Acme Oyster House was a shining beacon in the darkness which has been Oysters in my life. Other than that, I can't say my po-boy was extra special or that my bf's soft shell crabs were the best ever. They were all ok. Service could definitely be better (and we definitely experienced better service and the famed Southern hospitality at several other NOLA establishments).

Prior to coming to NOLA, I've only had oysters once in my life and I remember not liking it, but this place changed my perspective. I recommend trying both the chargrilled and raw oysters here. All of the oysters had no sand or shell bits. The raw oysters were fresh and chargrilled oysters were cooked to perfection. The chargrilled oysters were also extremely buttery and came with some bread to soak up the extra juice.\n\nThe line to get in the restaurant was a little long, but well worth the wait.

This all definitely boils down to personal preference but the raw oysters were definitely WAY too big for my enjoyment. I had to slice them in half like a steak to eat- however, they were shucked down to the brim with a very fresh, oceany taste so I could see how people would really like them. \n\nWhat made this restaurant was 1) surprisingly cheap prices 2) other fried foods. We were so glad we decided to change our 2 dozen raw oysters to 1 dozen raw and 1 dozen chargrilled because the chargrilled oysters are BOMB.COM (and also what they're known for). Buttery, cheesy, garlicky saucy goodness that you can dip the bread they give you into. Gumbo was okay, and the gravy fries are necessary to complete the meal. We spent about $30~ each (3 people) for all this + a bottle of wine! Everyone else around us ordered po'boys or some other type of fried food that looked delicious, and I would definitely suggest to go that route.

Raw oysters are the meat so to speak of the Acme's business but don't ignore the fried oyster platter or the oyster po boy, transcendant!

We even soaked up the juices with the 3 pieces of bread... \n\nIn addition, we tried a bowl of seafood gumbo $7.49 and a large shrimp ettouffee $12.99. Both were pretty generic and nothing to write about... \n\nThe hype is true, ACME does serve up some of the best oyster in the city. We tried another place (Oceana Grill) and it just fall flat.

There's always a line, which I guess I'd expect with the amount of marketing they do. Honestly, it's good but why anyone would wait in line for an hour for oysters when there's 10 oyster bars within a two-block radius is beyond me.\n\nWe ordered:\n*2 dozen chargrilled oysters ($19.99 dozen) \n*craw balls app ($7)\n*1x beer \n\nTotals was around $55 but we spent an extra $20 tipping the oyster shuckers at the raw bar for being kind human beings and here's why:\n\nI brought a friend from out of town and Acme was her very first NOLA food experience (she had heard about it and very excitedly needed to go). \n\nIssue #1:\nWe get in line and the hostess walks right past us and skips putting our name on the list. We had to stop and tell her the third time she passed - which was interesting because she asked the person directly in front of us and the person directly behind us both other times. Overlooked that, c'est la vie.\n\nIssue #2:\nShe told me it would be a 30-minute wait and I should grab a drink so I said \"Good idea!\" and went off in search of libations. I returned moments later with two expensive daiquiris ($25 worth, not something I'd ever normally spend my $$ on but I was entertaining a guest) -- ten seconds later, our name was called (this was about four-five minutes after she told me 30 minutes. \nExcitedly, we walked in and sat down at the bar with our daiquiris and a waitress\/hostess immediately and rudely walks up and says \"no outside drinks!\" Our immediate response is that we didn't want to waste the $25 nor spend more time in line, so we looked like two deer caught in headlights. She said it loud, two more times, meaner and more demanding each time. The oyster shucker looked at us, took pity, and grabbed our drinks, placing them under the bar out of sight then telling her we're all set. She proceeded to bitch out her KIND coworkers in front of us for doing this which was entirely unacceptable. She then treated us like we had done something wrong when we even offered to throw them out because we wanted to stay and the nice shucker said not to worry about it. He told his manager who also seemed fine with it --- anyway, I'm just pissy because my friend's very first Nola food experience was a bitchy hostess. One employee told me I had time to grab a drink, so I did. Then I got bitched at for having said drinks.  The three guys behind the bar were great and kind --- which was much appreciated. \n\nIssue #3: \nI eat chargrilled oysters a lot. I've never had them so salty as these. They're better at the little dive bar, MRB, on St. Phillip, and for $3 cheaper per dozen with a much nicer staff \n...and no wait. \n\nI had hoped this would be a great experience, and I was really disappointed that it wasn't even a good one.

During that short time, we discovered a historic city with long traditions of great music, outstanding food & continuing perseverance.\n\nBefore I actually get into this review, I have a confession to make (which I have mentioned in a few of my other reviews): I'm not a huge fan of oysters. The girlfriend, on the other hand, loves oysters nearly to the point of obsession. Regardless of our relative level of oyster infatuation, we had both heard so much praise for Acme Oyster House that we had to go. Just like so many other popular places in New Orleans, the 1st couple times we walked by to check it out, we observed a long line to get in. So, we devised a strategy to show up shortly before opening time.\n\nIt worked, mostly. Arriving early, there was only a short line. We actually ended up getting in & getting a table ahead of the line because we were party of 2 & the line was larger groups. Acme Oyster House has a very fun & lively vibe. The staff are a smiling & jovial bunch. The girlfriend & I started with a round of Bloody Marys. The girlfriend ordered a Fried Oyster Po-Boy & the soup of the day, Crab & Corn Chowder. I ordered a Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy & Red Beans & Rice. We also added an order of 1 dozen Chargrilled Oysters because we had numerous recommendations for the Chargrilled Oysters at Acme Oyster House.\n\nExpectations based on recommendations can be dicey. The girlfriend & I had already been to a couple spots in town that had fallen short of expectations built up from recommendations. This was definitely not the case at Acme Oyster House. \"Meets or exceeds\" is my evaluation of our experience vs. expectation here. My Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy lived up to its name & was easily delicious enough to persuade forgiveness from even the most enraged heart. My Red Beans & Rice were excellent. I tried a couple spoonfuls of the girlfriend's Crab & Corn Chowder & that was really good too. Ah, but the Chargrilled Oysters. I'm not someone who would go out of his way for oysters but I would absolutely go as far out my way as necessary for the Chargrilled Oysters at Acme Oyster House. So good.\n\nEverything about Acme Oyster House was exceptional: atmosphere, service & for sure, the food. I don't love oysters but I loved the oyster dishes (as well as the others) at Acme Oyster House.","date":1298418602000}

Also really tiny - the smallest I saw the entire trip to NOLA. The chargrilled are better than the raw, but still tiny and super grainy. The cheese is great and the flavor is spot on, but they don't give you enough bread and no sauce so you have to hope you got some with the raw.

We got in late on a Wednesday night so we found this place as I was craving oysters and they were open till midnight!\n\nIt was a packed house and I am glad we didn't have to wait for a table for long. Our host and server were friendly. The place was pretty dark so it was hard to take good pictures. Our server was cool and attended to us efficiently. We ordered hurricanes as this was their special drinks. It was pretty strong and they serve it in plastic cups. I guess its for to-go?\n\nWe all ordered different things to try everything. We did get a dozen oysters on a half shell and charbroiled oysters. The chilled oysters are a little bigger and darker than the ones I get in Cali. This was still good and did not have that sea taste. Its served with cocktail sauce and horseradish. The horseradish was not spicy at all. The charbroiled oysters were good but can be a little salty due to the cheese and butter. The oysters hella shrunk! Its good served with french bread to soak up the butter and cheese. This is what we ordered as meals:\n\n1\/2 Shrimp Po Boy sandwich - was good and had a lot of breaded shrimp. This was big for a half sandwich. It was kinda big and messy to eat but also felt like there was more bread to the shrimp. \n\nSide cup seafood gumbo - was good. No kick in it.\n\nBoo Fries - is similar to Poutine Fries; gravy and shredded beef on fries but it was good.\n\nSeafood Ettoufee - was good and had a few pieces but not all that special to me.\n\nNew Orleans Medley - was ok. It was a sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and grilled smoked sausage. The jambalaya was dry, the smoked sausage was not spicy.\n\nI give this more a 3.7 stars. Customer service was good, tables were sticky, food and drinks were pretty good but I was wondering ...I thought cajun food was spicy?  ;-p","date":1443414953000}

Now i can't tell you if i flashed for some HUMONGOUS beads or not, since i did tell myself i wouldn't do it, but hey its New Orleans right?! \n\nI got in town by myself, but fortunately my hotel was around the corner from Bourbon Street so it wasn't hard to keep myself busy.  Every night i would walk around Bourbon Street and check out the entertainment while sipping on some alcoholic drinks.  Each time i went out I would walk by the Acme Oyster House & it always has a VERY long line.  I wasn't sure what the hype was, but i was determined to try it before i leave.  The night before i had to fly out i went there around 5pm, knowing there wouldn't be a line that early & sure enough i got in & was able to sit by the bar where they were shuckling oysters.  Everyone at the bar, including the host are super duper nice!  \n\nFor starters I had the gumbo, 1\/2 chargrilled oysters and the fresh oysters.  For my main entree I had the fried soft shell crab poboy (my first poboy ever) and for dessert I got the bread pudding and the pecan cobbler....yes, i threw this all down in one sitting by myself!  Everything was pretty darn good...the soft shell crab poboy barely fit around my mouth cuz it was so huge, but it did not deter me to kill it with the use of dozens of napkins...i was one messy girl!  The pecan cobber wasn't what i expected, it came in a martini glass with ice-cream and caramel oozing everywhere...delicious!  The oysters were alright, i had better & some of them were quite large.  I prefer the Pacific NW Oysters, but you know i'm a northwest girl so i'm kinda bias...hehehehe.\n\nOk, so here's THE BEST part.  As i was sitting there stuffing my face a contestant for the 15 dozen oysters in one hour contest decided to sit next to me.  So, in order to support him i had to continously order food so i don't get booted off my seat (there was a line building in the front).  As i was encouraging the contestant i gave him some advice i thought would allow him to win.  I told the man to inhale it like he was swallowing water & to NOT stop...=)  I have watched a few food contest over the years so i thought it was really good advice.  He was doing sooOO good, but on his 15th dozen he stood up turned & looked at me then threw up all over the bar & the shuckling area.  I jumped up so fast that i could of had whipped-lash!  Rather than being upset I was laughing my head off & I thought the whole thing was wonderful, even if he did have puke in my soda & food.  For some reason the guy didn't look very happy about my advice.  Seriously, i think his downfall was he ate too much cocktail sauce & drank way too much water...the puke was brownish.  Plus, the workers there told him to stand up so it won't sit on top of his belly & he didn't listen.  I seriously think i can do it, but i don't know if i wanna pay for 15 dozen at $20 a pop.  If i ever decide to do it i'm gonna take my own advice & see if it works for me.  \n\nOverall, a great experience!  Everyone is super nice there & i would come back just to see if I can support another contestant!","date":1311013870000}

Acme Oyster House is an institution and came recommended from a colleague\/friend as well as fellow Yelpers. \n\nWhen I called last Friday night, there was an automated answering machine saying they do not take reservations. Somehow, my colleague called and someone said it would be a 20 minute wait. \n\nWe estimate we approached Acme from where we were staying in the Central Business District at 8 pm and thought the line didn't look too bad. It wasn't until 8:40 pm before we sat down. \n\nI think Leslie was our server and she was awesome. She didn't miss a beat and in that respect was super quick when she could have slowed down. For instance, we took some time to look over the menu and agree on what to share. When she came over, we were ready to list all our choices but instead she heard chargrilled oysters and ran off.\n\nThankfully, she came back with some water and took the rest of our order: boo fries (with roast beef gravy and cheese), boom boom shrimp, seafood etouffee, and 1\/2 & 1\/2 po boy (shrimp and fried fish). For dessert, we split the New Orleans Bread pudding with whiskey sauce. All in all, the bill came out to about $75 and we left a $15 tip. \n\nAs far as service, Leslie stopped by once or twice to bring a couple of extra napkins and filled up our cups only after they had been empty for awhile. She was smart to have brought three spoons to share dessert and provided a couple of extra spoons so we can eat family style. \n\nEverything was amazing but in the end, we agreed we could have done without the boo fries. We loved the chargrilled oysters, as none of us had it prepared that way before. The French bread was great for soaking up the juices and the oysters were well seasoned with spices and cheese.\n\nThe boom boom shrimp was delicious and not at all the spicy it promised to be. To me, it was more sweet than spicy, but I loved the shrimp. I also very much enjoyed the etouffee as it was comforting after a long wait out in the cold. My colleague really liked the fish po boy, but I thought both the fish and shrimp were well done. Unfortunately, the pickles arrived with the sandwiches but somehow fell off the plate when the plate hit the table. Too bad. After eating other po boys this weekend, pickles would have been good.\n\nThe bread pudding was pretty good too and none of us could detect the whiskey sauce. We were impressed with the diced up apples hidden in the pudding which gave it a little more texture and depth in flavor. \n\nThe place was loud and kind of dark, but with this nice and limited but delicious offering of NOLA foods, it was easy to overlook especially since we were told our non oyster order would come out before the oysters. Oysters ended up coming out first, by the way, but the other food came out pretty soon after we were done. \n\nGreat place, worth the wait, and pretty affordable (especially after coming from the Northeast).

I also got the etouffe\u00e9.  If you prefer etouffe\u00e9 with a stronger tomato base, then you'll enjoy it here (I liked and enjoyed it, but I preferred the etouffe\u00e9 with less tomato base at a different location in the Quarters (see my other review for details of the other place).\n\nMy friend had the crab cake and gumbo.  \nI sampled each. It was okay. The crabcake was fried up nice, but it wasn't flaky or lumpy crab meat.  Although crunchy on the outside, it was mushy on the inside.  The gumbo, well,  it was simply okay.  I've had better elsewhere.\n\nI noticed a plate of fried calamari being served to other customers.  Now that looked right.  It was fried up right... Darn, wish we ordered those!\n\nRecommendations or sure thing: Charbroiled Oysters\nappetizers of fried calamari\n\nFYI: This place is busy as heck (and this was during the slow season).

We had a party of 14 ppl. We waited in line for 1 hr exactly. The wait wasn't bad because there was a live band on Burbon so we were able to listen to the music and face and people watch.\n\nI ordered the boo fries. I think I was too excited about the idea of hot French fries with roast beef, gravy and cheese. I was a little disappointed because they were room temp and soggy as if they had sat a while. For my entree I ordered the small etouffe with a side of fries crawfish. While the etouffe was good, it too was room temp and the crawfish taste as if they were died in old oil and were not seasoned.\n\nBut being optimistic as I am, I went for a dessert.

The atmosphere inside is great - plenty going on but still able to have a conversation.\n\nThe food - the specialty is the chargrilled oysters, and they are a MUST HAVE if you're in New Orleans. The best I've had. Cooked in just the right amount of butter, garlic and cheese, with fresh bread to slurp up the extra sauce, these are big, creamy flavoursome oysters that even non-seafood fans should try. The boo fries are also a great addition, as are their poboys, gumbo and fried crawfish tails. \n\nAn absolute must-do!","date":1443065667000}

Oh the good ole days.  Anyways let's get back on track, Acme Oyster House is the bomb and you should stop on by.  My sister and I (yes we eat out together a lot) dropped in for brunch and we must have come at the right time because there was no wait and were seated immediately at the bar.  When we left there was a line outside the restaurant, sorry suckers! \n\nSince we weren't too hungry (keyword TOO because we have healthy appetites) we split an order of the jambalaya, a cup of gumbo, a dozen raw oysters, and each had an oyster shooter.  Is this how the other half of the world lives??  The oysters we ordered were delicious, not necessarily the best I've ever had but they were decent sized and had substance to them.  The oyster shooter was a little stronger than expected and burned a bit going down due to the horseradish and vodka but I guarantee it will wake your behind up!  The jambalaya was DELICIOUS.  I've had jambalaya in Chicago and my mom used to attempt to make it when we were kids but it does not compare to this.  The rice was cooked perfectly whereas other jambalaya I've had was sticky or mushy and the seasoning was on point with a nice kick from the andouille sausage.  I highly recommend trying the jambalaya.  The last thing we tried was the cup of the seafood gumbo which I enjoyed but my sister wasn't a fan of.  Good, more for me!  It had shrimp and supposedly crab but I couldn't find any in there and a scoop of rice on top. It wasn't overly flavorful but definitely is good comfort food.  \n\nI like to think my sister and I are professional eaters, we literally sat down, ate, and paid the check within 15 minutes.  Impressive, right?  It also helps that the service was on point, we received our oyster shooters almost immediately after placing the order followed by the rest of the food within minutes.  Now that is my kind of dining. What I'd take away from my brunch experience here is that service is quick, ambiance is casual and welcoming, and the food is delicious.","date":1437746317000}

I am.. I am..I am .. My order arrived with enough sliced bread on top to feed a country...(turn off) but what was underneath were sizzling, fresh chard beauties.  Was the char aroma divine? Hell yeah. Were they good? Yup.  Were a few of them MIA in their shell because they were charred to high hell and evaporated ? Unfortunately yes..\n\nShrimp and desserts ok but not worthy of mention.\n\nSo with that being said ...was everything great? No, but it was good.  I saw, conquered and experienced  and for me.. this is a novelty kinda place, a smidgen dirty, and given this town is a sinners paradise .. too many other joints to look into and check out.","date":1478615980000}

Reviewed by over 1800 on Yelp and liked by many on Urbanspoon, this touristy restaurant has seen both good days and bad.  First opened in the 1920's, their claim to fame is - obviously, oysters.  When we went, we had the chargrilled oysters as our appetizer, which was quite heavy (LOTS of butter)!   Beware, those who can't take all the greasiness!  What's worse is they provide bread to soak up all the butter... Three was definitely enough (while I can easily eat a dozen of raw ones of the same size).  We also had the Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy, which is a fried oyster and shrimp sandwich with a tabasco mayo sauce.  I was rather disappointed by the flavoring of this sandwich, even though I love oysters and shrimp!  The oysters were alright, while the shrimp was lacking in freshness and...shrimp.  It was mostly batter, and the flavor was just a bit flat.  The po' boy as a whole just didn't look all that fresh, which was really disappointing!  We also shared the Fried Fish Platter, which was just more fried food.  We could have ordered something that wasn't fried - but in reality - almost everything on the menu is fried!  The fried fish was hot and fresh and not at all fishy, though.  The batter was crisp, and the fish fried to perfection on this occasion.  This sounds a terrible, but the hush puppies and the fried fish may have been my favorite part of my experience at Acme.\n\nWhether its raw or chargrilled oysters that fit your fancy, Acme will take care of ya, but at quite the price.  The novelty of this place was enough to bring me here once, but probably not again.  The terribly slow and rude service (I'm not the only one) combined with the price does not compel me to dine here twice.","date":1392689950000}

Like other reviewers, I agree it's worth the wait. \n\nThe line actually goes pretty fast because this is not a fine dining restaurant so people are probably done eating in less than an hour.

Not overdone though. \n\nThe soft shell crab was very good. Cole slaw was average but didn't take away from the experience. Hush puppies had a slight yellow cake taste (rather than grainy and savory).

Although there was a wait on Saturday at 1:00 PM, the line moved quickly, and our party of 6 was in within 30 minutes. Was seated in the back, and the restaurant is much longer than I had expected. A bit dark and chilly in here. Between the 6 of us, we had about 5 dozen oysters, ALONG with entrees. The oysters were THAT good, and we regretted getting our entrees as the oysters were filling enough. Especially the CHARGRILLED! I've had a variation of it made by a friend back home, but man oh man. Buttery, garlicy, cheesy goodness, all grilled on a fresh oyster! Best part is they give you slices of french bread to dip or douse in the butter left in the shell or on the plate. YUMMMMMM. We were in heaven! \n\nI ordered the famous Fried Peace Maker Po Boy, which has fried oysters and fried shrimp and their tabasco infused mayo (we also learned that day that Tabasco is originally from LA! Who knew?). The bread was that french bread goodiness, but I was too full to enjoy it. Also realized I'm not a fan of fried oysters. I expected more, being one of the top 10 sandwiches, but it was just okay. It still tasted good as a leftover though, so that's always a good sign.\n\nWe also ordered a sign of their Boo Fries. Gravy and cheese smothered fries. I was hesitant, as it sounded like a weird combination, but delicious! The jambalaya was ok, nothing spectacular, and their etoufee was okay too.\n\nService was great, our waitress would even bring refills on our sodas without us asking. We had way too much food though, and our table barely had space for all our food.\n\nDefinitley order the raw and chargrilled oysters here, and if you're still hungry, the Boo Fries!","date":1332880866000}

Other than that, the place wasn't all that spectacular. \nThe inside was cute, super loud with a cool bar area that you can sit and watch oysters being shucked, etc. We were seated at a really small table next to a large group, and I had to get up anytime someone in the larger party wanted to get up. Not ideal, but not worth complaining about.\nOur server was generally nice. He recommended some beers for us to try out that ended up being delicious, and of course recommended the chargrilled oysters. These things were amazing. They came out piping hot, most of them were a good size, and the flavor was spot on. Cheesy, garlicky, buttery, sinful. We did ask for more bread to dip into the leftover sauce, because why wouldn't you. \nI also tried a cup of the seafood gumbo, which wasn't that great.

The chargrilled oysters are season with garlic and salted and cook over the open flame.

The oysters here are better than the one we have in Florida. They are fresh and big. Somehow the swamp water breeds a better oyster. The fried crawfish tail is great to go with the beer. The fried blue crab craws are much better in this case. It is heavenly good. We were joking may be order to go order and sell with double price for the people who are waiting hour in line. \n\nSince they are open for lunch at 10:30 am, it is consider brunch. You actually can skip the breakfast at Cafe du Monde and come here for better food experience. I have pick this restaurant to be one of the best in New Orleans to close my double digit review.","date":1423624468000}

As soon as we walked in, I knew we had made a mistake. The place is reminiscent of a TGI Friday's and Bubba Gump Shrimp aka tourist trap with mediocre food. We went ahead and ordered a dozen raw oysters, a half dozen of chargrilled oysters and a shrimp po'boy. The raw oysters weren't great and the cooked ones just tasted like butter. Our po'boy was good. However, the service felt rushed and inattentive. Our server took our hot sauces without even telling us why she was taking them or asking if we would mind, total turn off.

Our server was very friendly and offered terrific suggestions, cluing us in on what I think is actually their best dish... the fried catfish. Don't get me wrong, the chargrilled oysters were fantastic, but the fish was cooked perfectly, super crispy on the outside and flaky and moist on the inside. I especially enjoyed it with the cocktail sauce... it had a little kick! The softshell crab po boy was also delicious, but a little messy to eat. I wish I could review their desserts, but we could barely finish our meals because the portions are crazy generous! \n\nHonestly, my recommendation for two people would be to split a dozen of the chargrilled oysters and a fried fish plate.

One of the places we were told we had to try was Acme Oyster House, and that we had to get there early in order to avoid waiting in line.  Of course, we did not heed that warning and arrived around 6:30 and ended up waiting in line for about one hour.  Once we got inside, we were seated at a large picnic style table shared with several other couples\/families.  The ambiance was loud and the decor was casual in a sports bar style way with lots of pictures, and neon signs all over the place.  Our server was quick to appear and got us our drinks and took our order within 5 minutes.  Although, I am pretty sure that he already knew we were going to order Oysters, it was just a matter of which kind and if we wanted any of their Famous \"Boo Fries,\" which are French fries topped with their own roast beef gravy and cheese.  Of course, we could not resist trying the fries, and, boy, we were not disappointed with that choice.  Being it was my first time trying oysters, my wife (who had tried raw oysters before) said we should order both Raw Oysters and Chargrilled Oysters.  The food arrived within 15 mins, which was amazing considering this place was packed full with at least 150 people (or more).  So, I tried both raw and chargrilled and I must say that I prefer the chargrilled oysters over the raw ones.  Chargrilled oysters are \"Sizzling, chargrilled oysters saturated in an herb butter sauce, topped with a special blend of cheese.\"  As I did not have anything to compare the oysters to from previous eateries, I will say that I loved oysters (chargrilled style), and will always order them if\/when available on the menu.

The catfish po-boy was soft but flavorful and was my favorite. I saw an Acme Oyster House at the airport and ordered the catfish po-boy again and it was nothing like the one I had here - probably because it had no sauce whatsoever! Our server was awesome. \n\nThe line was not that long and it was still a 45 minute wait. When we first arrived, the hostess mentioned that it would not take that long to seat a party of 6 because there was a table for 6 that was open. We weren't seated until 45 minutes later so at first I thought another group of 6 was ahead of us. The person behind us was in line for a group of 14. The hostess told him that they had space for them if his entire party was present but won't seat them unless the entire party was present. After we had gotten in 45 minutes later, I saw that there was a table of 8 and a table of 6 right next to each other that stayed empty until the group behind me came in about 30 minutes after we sat down. I really don't understand why this place would \"hold\" a table for 14 for that long!!!","date":1298962815000}

I'm glad I didn't share this! The sauce is sticky and sweet with a bit of heat. I could have easily put that over pasta for an amazing entree. \n-Raw Oysters - I dont eat these, but they were DEVOURED and the table ordered another dozen. Big and meaty. \n-Charbroiled Oysters - another I didnt eat but those that did ate them just as fast as the raw ones. Another dozen ordered as well! \n-Fish and Shrimp Platter - I had this and WOW so much food! Two of us ordered this same thing and we could have easily split it. three huge white fish filets, about 12 fried shrimp, hush puppies (like 6 of them) and french fries. I had a few stray fried oysters on my plate too that were good as well. The batter is not greasy or thick, which I appreciated.\n-To drink i ordered the Killer Buzz and it did not live up to its name. it's insanely sickly sweet, i took a few sips and it was overwhelming so I didnt finish it. \n-Bananas Foster Cheesecake - very rich but so good! \n\nOverall if we had the time we would have gone back, so yes this was definitely a win!","date":1582053432000}

We had the boo fries with cheese and beef gravy, the fried peace maker po-boy which had golden fried oysters and shrimp.  According to the menu, this was voted #4 on Top Ten sandwiches.  And I must say, this sandwich was probably one of the best po-boys I have eaten in NOLA.  It was tasty, the seafood was almost perfect, and the sauces they mixed together were solely just scrumptious.  I almost ordered another one on my own if we didn't order more craw fish.\n-We also had the raw and chargrilled oysters and of course, three pounds of craw fish.  My favorite were the chargrilled oysters, they were seasoned so well, they left me wanting more.  The raw oysters were very good too, but if I had to pick between the two, I would highly recommend chargrilled oysters.  They really were one of a kind and you probably won't ever taste this anywhere else.  The craw fish was good, I've always thought craw fish was not worth eating since they require so much work for such a small piece of seafood.  But hey, my girlfriends wanted them so we ordered them.  \n-The inside was nicely decorated and the servers were so nice and attentive.  Our server saw that our hands were dirty from eating the craw fish so she got us wet wipes on her own without us asking.  I thought that was really sweet, even though they were very busy, they still paid attention to the little things.  \n \nImprovement:\n-The only thing I can say that needs improvement is the little space we had at the dinner table.

We walked past the long line, nodding our heads and fist bumping each other (because we're so VIP). Our waitress, Jovon, had a great attitude - very sweet with a sparkly personality. This is just about where the compliments end.\n\nLet's all do a little math shall we? I ordered...\n- (6) Raw Oysters\n- (12) Char Grilled Oysters\n- (1) Oyster Shooter\n- (1) 10 Napkin Roast Beef Po'boy\n\nBut I received...\n- (6) Raw Oysters.... lovely and briny, but pricier than I'm used to\n- (6) Char Grilled Oysters... my favorite of the night, but sadly, they only brought out half of what I ordered\n- (0) Oyster Shooter... The waitress was so busy running around that she forgot the shooter. I understand they're busy, but wish I hadn't gotten my hopes up.\n- (1)10 Napkin Roast Beef Po'boy... Don't be so proud of your messy sandwich ACME. The bread was stale, and the meat was like canned roast\/corned beef. I tore off one bite, then gave my boyfriend stink eyes. \"This was better last time I tried it,\" he said...\n\nI'm not mathematician, but I'm pretty sure that 6+12+1+1 does NOT equal 6+6+0+1. The 12 oysters that I did receive were riddled with bits of broken shell. What the shuck ACME?! You call yourself an oyster house? Additionally, a fun and upbeat waitress does not equal good service. Besides getting our order wrong, we were also brought the wrong bill. I think it's safe to say that something just doesn't add up at ACME Oyster House, and no amount of their grilled oysters can remedy that.","date":1412104567000}

We tried to get food here on a Friday night around 9p but the line was wrapped around the corner. Since it closed at 11p, we didn't bother and decided to come back on today (Memorial Day). Great choice because we were third and fourth in line at 1013a (doors opened at 1030a).\n\nThe restaurant reminds me of an old school pizza place with its dark interior, kneon signs and dark paneled walls. Really cute with a casual feel. We were seated in the corner next to the kitchen so we could see everything in the front of the restaurant (the kitchen, the bar and the entrance). There is additional seating in the back past the kitchen as well. \n\nWithin 3m of being seated we were greeted by a waitress who immediately asked if we were interested in the charbroiled oysters. We ordered a dozen of those and the craw puppies as appetizer. I also ordered a hurricane and he ordered a bloody mary. We like our drinks to pack a punch so because our drinks were weak, we both requested an extra shot which was perfect! Those charbroiled oysters smelled awesome so I tried a piece with a piece of that melt I your mouth bread it came with and was pleasantly surprised. It was very tasty! And those craw puppies were very spicy and full of flavor. Loved them also. For the entree I ordered 1 crab cake which came with french fries and 1 side which I chose potato salad. He ordered the fried shrimp and oyster po boy with a side of gumbo. My crab cake was larger than I expected, it didn't have much flavor but it was full of lump crabmeat. If they had seasoned it more, it would be perfect. The french fries were average shoestring fries but I didnt like the potato salad. It was full of onions and mayo. I like my potato salad without onions and with eggs, mayo, mustard and relish (Louisiana girl). It also came with bread but I didnt eat it. He loved his fried oyster and shrimp po boy. He said the bread was soft and the fried shrimp and oysters had a nice flavor but he said the gumbo was nothing special...he said some of the rice was hard. Lol\n\nOverall, our experience was good. The service and drinks were good and the oysters were better than average.","date":1496096239000}

We were visiting New Orleans for my bachelorette party, so we ordered several dishes and drinks to really get a taste of everything.\nWe started out the order with a dozen chargrilled oysters and two spicy oyster shooters. The shooters were a kick in the face and exactly what we needed to warm ourselves up from the chilly 30-degree weather outside. \n\nThe chargrilled oysters came out with bread for the herb butter sauce and cheese that the oysters were saturated in and let me tell you, those were the best oysters I've ever had in my entire life (and I live in coastal south Florida). I could taste *everything* so distinctly, and the sauce was so delicious, we asked for more servings of bread to soak it all up. For my entree, I ordered the Acme Poopa; a french bread bowl filled with your choice of gumbo (my choice was the chicken and andouille sausage gumbo). The dish was warm, hearty, full of flavor and delicious textures (and was also my first time trying gumbo). I'd definitely order it next time I'm in New Orleans. My friends ordered the fried fish po-boy and the Acme Poopa but with seafood gumbo instead and they didn't have enough for leftovers. \n\nBy far, Acme was my favorite restaurant of our entire trip. \nThe service was excellent even though there wasn't an empty seat in the house and there wasn't a single thing I didn't find delicious and worth every cent.","date":1518106519000}

So we went somewhere else and then came back a few days later, and man oh man do I regret eating at the other place because this place was insanely good. We got almost all the exact same dishes as the other place and not 1 single dish compared to the quality and flavor of ACME. YUM!!!\n\nThis is what we got:\n\nCharbroiled oysters: highly recommend - cheese garlic butter charbroiled oysters. Delicious!\n\nFresh oysters: Good. Fresh. Nothing else to really say about it because you can't really show talent in fresh uncooked oysters. Though the marinara sauce had a stronger horseradish flavor which I thought made it taste really good.\n\nSeafood platter: highly recommend. Get this! good sampler of everything. Comes with fries, and fried fish, shrimp and oysters\n\nSeafood etouffee - highly recommend. sooo sooo soooo good. This was the first dish to be cleared out. So flavorful, cajun and buttery\/creamy over rice. Everything about it was just perfect!\n\nJambalaya - also really good. Very flavorful and not too overpowering of fennel that I've had at other places.\n\nPoboy (the most popular one) with fried shrimp and oysters. - average. I thought it was just alright. Nothing too fancy. The bread was soft and crispy, but other than that, couldn't taste the fried seafood and there wasn't enough garlic aioli. It definitely needed additional sauce to make it taste decent. \n\nBoom boom shrimp - fried shrimp with sweet\/sour sauce. Almost like asian flavored fried shrimp. Nothing special, but it was good at least.\n\nAlso got red breans and rice and a chicken gumbo, which I thought was ok.\n\nAfter all that split with 7 people, we were still hungry. But it was definitely delicious. In summary. 4 stars because not all the dishes were amazing, (definitely better than the other place we went), and not the best value for the amount spent.

My memory must've been foggy because when I came over 12+ years ago, I didn't remember it being such a slam dunk!\n\nAs you all know, this is one of those touristy places that you have to go to if you've never been to NOLA but for the record, let me tell you, it's SO worth the trip.  We tried Felix, Killer Poboy and NOLA Poboys all in the same week and none of these places served a better Poboy than the Peacemaker at Acme.  So ginormous, you can actually just share this and you'd still be full to the gills.  GET IT!  5\/5\n\nAnd contrary to popular opinion as New Englanders, I'd also stuff your face with at least a half dozen of the Chargrilled Oysters as opposed to ordering the standard raw preparation.  Taste tested and confirmed as we ordered both.  I know you're shocked!  Why you ask?  It's actually quite simple.  The local oysters here from the Gulf of Mexico (on average) are much larger yet more milder tasting so it's perfect to try these prepared in other cooking methods.   We absolutely enjoyed these and it's forever changed our perspective that a cooked oyster could never taste as good as the raw variety.  5\/5   \n\nIf you're into crab cakes, they do it quite well here too.  Ask for a side of their special house remoulade sauce and make sure you smother it well with it.  You can work it all off later :)  4\/5\n\nReally liked the decor of the place too.  It added to the friendly, casual Southern character you'd expect.  Service was all around friendly and we totally lucked out too since we were there during the slow season and didn't need to wait for a table and it's unheard of for this place.  \n\nIt's a \"can't miss\" spot.

Acme is no exception.  Just three weeks ago, my wife and I drove to Boston to eat at the Neptune Oyster Bar.  We savored the delicate flavors of the kumamotoes, the kushi's, maine and cap cod oysters.  Some reminded us of the sea, the kushi of cucumbers.  Heading to NOLA, we were excited to sample LA oysters for the first time.  Oh, what a disappointment.  \n\nWe asked to be seated at the bar so we could see the oysters shucked.  We immediately noticed that the oysters, and the bin the oysters are held, are covered with Lousiana mud.  The shucker's hand, and shucking tool, also were completely covered in mud.  After opening each oyster, he'd use the muddy tool to separate the oyster from its shell.  \n\nLousiana oysters are big compared to oysters from the pacific northwest and the northeast, as other yelpers have pointed out, and not terribly expensive.  But as we were disappointed to discover, LA oysters are also rather tasteless.  Quite frankly, the only 'flavor' I could taste was the gravelly mud that was smeared on the oyster, from forementioned muddy tool.  They just weren't good.  Expecially in contrast with our experience in Boston where the oysters actually had subtle flavors of sweetness, saltiness, and so on.  Sadly, another case of quantity over quality.  Not surprising for an establishment that hangs a sign with names of patrons that can dozens of oysters over a short period of time.   I suppose I'm not the right target customer.  The Acme customer is the guy who recently yelped that he could \"throw down oysters\" and had \"36 oysters in like 5 minutes\".  \n\nWe also tried the fried oysters and the char-grilled oysters.  Fried oysters weren't bad, but it wasn't because of the oysters.  It was the fried dough that was good.

We ended up taking a couple of bar seats at the oyster bar, and the oyster shuckers were sort of our servers too. \n\nI didn't love the charbroiled oysters here nearly as much as Drago's. It was hot off the flame, but somehow didn't have the same satisfying quality. Less butter\/cheese, and the oysters were shrunken under the heat to oblivion (maybe without enough of that safety blanket of cheese and fat)? The raws were okay, the same as anywhere else. \n\nWe had shrimp etouffee too, and it was kind of average. Pretty filling. \nI liked hanging out here and enjoying the atmosphere and reading about the history, so if the line isn't ridiculous, and you have enough time in New Orleans to visit many oyster houses, this is worth the middle of your list somewhere.

It has been on my bookmark list for a minute. What better time than to visit for St. Patrick's day. The line is super long. I recorded a video the night we wanted to go and the line was too long. The next day as I was in line, it wasn't that bad. We didn't wait that long.They come and ask how many are in your party. As tables become available, they seat you. For example, if you are in a party of six and you are next in the door, but a party of 3 is behind you, it depends on what table opened up. If that table of 3 opened up first, the group second in line is going before you.\n\n Once our party was seated, our waitress came right over. She got our appetizers (crawfish and oysters) going and we ordered some po boys. The oysters were delicious and huge! Normally I can eat a few dozen, but here I could only put away 2 dozen. The peacemaker po boy was good as well. I got to have a shrimp and oyster po boy at the same time. The crawfish were well seasoned and they didn't last long at our table. The chargrilled oysters are tasty as well. I prefer the raw but hey you can't go wrong with either. A few things to know before you go:\n\n- Everyone must be present in party before you are seated\n- No split checks\n- Only 2 forms of payment per check but not two cards (one card and the rest in cash)\n- Prepare to wait\n- Once party is called, move quickly\n- If you are drinking outside, you can't bring it inside. Pour it out or gulp it down.\n- Rudeness or just plain drunk can get you removed from establishment or even line outside (some of the things I seen geez)","date":1458595105000}

There was a strong Parmesan flavor and crisp atop the oysters. \n\nHad we not tried other oyster places that just happened to taste better, we would've left thinking that ACME was decisively the best, because it's very good.

We asked our waiter to be moved and they were happy to and asked us to wait a minute while they were clearing another table.

I had already looked at the table and it had 7 chairs, no biggie we would squeeze in if it meant getting away from the busy front door. The manager said again, no we won't fit in which I told him it would be fine we would fit. He than told me \"we were not going to play musical chairs, everyone else has sat at this very table all day with no complaints\". WOW, the rudest manager I have ever encountered. So we sat and froze. One of our guests ordered the large bowl of seafood gumbo which came out in a saucer about an 1\" deep and 6\" across. We asked another gentleman (different from first one who was rude) about the size and he was quick to snap back saying that was for sure the large. I asked how many ounces were in the small and large gumbos to which he responded with 6oz in the small cup and 8oz in the large bowl. I then asked to speak to the manager again and he responded with \"oh I am the manager\" and walked away. WORST customer service I've ever received!

Definitely recommend any of the oysters and the boo fries were a great accompaniment.

The space is big: there is a bar for drinks, oyster bar (for shucked raw oysters) and tables for people to sit and feast.\n\nThis was our first night out in NOLA. We were excited! We waited for a table and the wait was about 20-30 minutes.\n\nWe sat near the bar. I could see everything, the TVs playing the basketball game, the bar, the oyster shucking station and all the tables. There was so much noise: talking, laughing, clattering of dirty plates behind the bar, and people dancing. \n\nWe ordered: 2 Medleys (gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice + fried soft shell crab), 1 dozen chargrilled oysters, 1 large Ettoufee with fried crawfish tails, 1 Jambalaya, and 1 cup of chicken and Andouille Gumbo. \nDessert: 1 bread pudding with scoop of vanilla ice cream. \n\nThe Good:\nThe chargrilled oysters were buttered, garlicky and so plump and delicious! I loved it! We took the bread to sop up the sauce. \nOne oyster had some sand. They weren't the best chargrilled oysters that we had in NOLA but they were a close 3rd. \n\nProtip: dip that bread daintily in the oyster sauce. Don't sop up a large amount of that sauce bc it is super salty!!\n\nThe fried soft shell crab was juicy, crispy and so light. The flavors were simple and the texture and cooking was well executed. \n\nThe bread pudding was delicious! It was gooey, sweet and had a great flan texture. Even though we were stuffed from all the food, we still devoured the dessert.\n\n\nThe ok: Andouille sausage. It was grilled in the medley. It was a good sausage. The large ettouffee had a little bit of seafood. The fried crawfish tails added more seafood and a bit of texture.\n\nThe red beans were buttered and broken down. They were ok. \n\nThe gumbo was a little salty and tasted nothing like what was made in the New Orleans Cooking School. \n\nI would definitely return to eat a plate of chargrilled oysters. \n\n\ninstagram.com\/snackchatnyc","date":1526672316000}

I referred back to her list when making a decision about dinner and decided that it was a good option.\n\nWe were seated fairly quickly after a brief wait outside. Our server greeted us right away and delivered much needed water to the table. We started with an order of oyster shooters - vodka, cocktail sauce, and a fresh raw shucked oyster. I was hesitant but my husband talked me into it, and I'm glad he did. The cocktail sauce and vodka was like a Bloody Mary and the oyster added good flavor. \n\nWe shared a half dozen chargrilled oysters after that. They were served bubbling hot with a side of fresh bread. I believe pretty much anything can be improved by garlic, cheese, and butter; these were not an exception to my life rule. \n\nI had the surf n' turf po'boy, which my friend had specifically called out as her favorite. It featured golden fried gulf shrimp and roast beef with a honey horseradish sauce. I was intrigued by the flavor combinations, not sure how it would all come together. It was magical - the fried shrimp added just the right amount of salt and crunch to the sweet and spicy roast beef. \n\nThe staff were efficient and helpful.

We had never been in New Orleans and  we drove up from Houston to the Lana del Rey concert the weekend of April 25th. Our first stop was to walk around downtown and grab something to eat. \n\nI had looked online to see what places were worth visiting and this restaurant was on the list. We were dying to have some New Orleans crawfish but reading online, we found out that the quarter is not so great for crawfish. Instead, we settled on eating a good appetizer before the night started. I saw online there was a lot of great reviews for Acme so we decided to try this place out. \n\nWe parked and walked towards the restaurant. Right away, we noticed there was a line of about 10 people standing outside. I was a little impressed to see there was actually a line - it has to be good, right?! We stood in line and because it was only two of us, we were able to get seated pretty quickly - before the 10 people. \n\nRight away, we agreed to try the oysters. We LOVE oysters. Little did we know, we would literally fall in LOVE. We are from Houston, so we've had our fair share of oysters but these were absolutely delicious. They were a decent size, not stale\/hard, smooth coming off the shell. They were so fresh. We ordered 3 dozen! We were that in love. We also shared  the New Orleans Medley which was incredibly delicious! This entire meal was outright perfect! I would eat the same exact meal if I could go back right now!\n\nThe restaurant itself is a little small and crowded which may drive people away but it's really not too bad and the food makes up for it! We sat at the bar so we didn't realize the restaurant was actually bigger until we had to go to the restroom which is at the back of the bar. it was a little odd to pass through the waters area to get to the other side of the restaurant\/bathrooms.  it's at a great location too! \n\nThe experience was amazing and this restaurant was great!

My fiance and I got here around 11am, and were seated immediately. Once we left at 11:30am, there was a short line (10 people) formed outside the restaurant. \n\nI got the Fried Peacemaker Po-Boy, which is supposedly their specialty. This sandwich has fried shrimp, fried oysters, and Tobasco-infused mayo. YUM!!!! It was just a hint of hot sauce, to really bring the whole sandwich together (not too spicy either, you could definitely add more). It was terrific. I loved every bite of my sandwich. The bread was perfect too - I felt like it was the \"supporting actor.\" The bread was slightly toasted, slightly doughy, and very plain. However, this is the kind of bread that went AMAZING and was great for the \"overall performance\" of the sandwich!!!\n\nMy fiance ordered the Seafood Etoufee, and you're able to add in fried crawfish tails too. This was a great dish, my first time having it, and it was basically like a seafood stew with the deep fried crawfish tails, served over rice. This was another solid dish! I would have preferred a little more rice to sauce ratio though, but that's just me.\n\nThey have oysters too, which is another must if you love oysters. You can get raw, or chargrilled, by the half or full dozen. We did half and half, which was a good decision. Not the best oysters I've ever had, but pretty damn cheap. I did like the chargrilled oysters, which I feel like you can only really get in NOLA. It's great to try if you haven't before.\n\nI wasn't a fan of their Mint Julep (too strong, too gross), but I did like their beer selection. I ended up getting a local IPA, which I loved.

He knew we weren't locals so he gave us suggestions on nightlife (where to go and where to stand clear from) and even introduced me to my first LA's brewed beer: the andygator! \n\nI ordered a pohboy (because I saw it on Man vs. Food and it looked delish) and it was amazing! Best part was it was affordable! After eating the pohboy, I was stuffed so I took an Andygator to-go and drank it while exploring the streets of downtown NOLA.\n\nI would totally eat here again if I had future visits to New Orleans. And I recommend everyone stopping by and eating a few fresh oysters!! Heck, even take your very own andygator beer home with you (I took some to Cali!)","date":1269912493000}

The price of a dozen gulf oysters has increased as expected with inflation, but they still offer good value. The crowds have grown to the point that you have to be a masochist to visit during any festival weeks - the wait standing on the sidewalk can be 45 minutes and up. Our solution has been to go at odd times when the wait might be tolerable. We did that this week, but after a short wait found that the service has become rude to the point of surliness. Who needs it? The same oysters can be found across the street at Felix's or next door at Dickie Brennan's, along with decent customer service.

If you're on\/around Bourbon St, Acme and Felix's are the two best-reviewed oyster houses and, having tried both, I have to give Acme a close second. \n\nThe line at Acme was always longer than the line directly across the street for Felix's, so you're likely to wait between 45 mins and 2 hrs if you come with a party of four or more during dinner hours. That said, they let you take pitchers of beer outside, so it's not as bad as it sounds if you're committed to having good seafood.  \n\nI'll base my ranking of Acme as the second-best oyster house on Iberville based on two dishes: chargrilled and raw oysters. The chargrilleds were a little overpowered by the parmesan cheese and the raw were too big for my taste (perhaps sacrilege to some, but although I love the flavor, I am a beginner).  One thing Acme did do much better than Felix's was beer--the draft selection was much larger and the Abita SOS is a great pilsner for washing down seafood. \n\nI also ate a pretty good (if standard) shrimp poboy, which had great fried shrimp and was made even better by the application of hot sauce (although I wish they offered something aside from Tobasco). \n\nOverall, a good meal, but not worth the wait with Felix's less than 200 ft away.","date":1362007145000}

WOW, just wow.  I never liked cooked oysters before, but decided to give it a try because my friends raved about it.  I initially planned to order just half a dozen of the chargrilled oysters and half a dozen of raw oysters.  However, my friend convinced me that I can have raw oysters anywhere, but chargrilled oysters were a specialty of Acme.  Glad I followed her advice!\n\nFirst of all, when the waiters delivered the chargrilled oysters to the table, I was fascinated to see that the oysters are still sizzling, such a beautiful sight to behold :)  I was worried that the oysters would be too buttery and cheesy that they would lose their brininess.  Even though it was true that oysters lost their \"oyster-ness\", i.e. the brininess, the satiny texture and the taste of sea, it didn't matter because that butter sauce was amazingggggg.  I was slurping down these babies at a superhuman speed, and can totally understand how someone can eat 14 dozens of them in one sitting (according to Acme's wall of fame).  I was sharing a dozen with my guy and we finished within 5 minutes.  We looked at each other, and wordlessly decided that we need another dozen. I also have to mention the bread, it was the perfect delivery system for that delicious butter sauce.  Words cannot describe how happy I was eating them.\n\nWe also tried the New Orleans Medley and a side of potato salad.  Both were good, but paled in comparison to those oysters.  I really wanted to come back and get two more dozens of oysters before we left NOLA, unfortunately we ran out of time.

When they came out I quickly realized they were oysters Rockefeller. I had had them before in Georgia and thought they were ok. \nThese were amazing!!! Soaked in delicious butter and parmesan cheese.  Could have used more bread to soak up the deliciousness. I would have ordered another dozen if I had not already gotten the fried crab platter. The crab was extremely greasy and wasn't really what I was expecting. It needed a sauce badly or even some ketchup. I ate half of one and took the rest home to eat the next day. My boyfriend got the oyster po boy. It was his first one and he thought it was pretty good - but by the end of the trip there were various other places that had better ones. \n\nIf anything get the char grilled oysters - you won't regret it!!

The chargrilled oysters were stellar as always but they didn't have raw oysters today! \u00c9touff\u00e9e was good - rich and creamy, but the Jambalaya was extremely salty and left much to be desired. Gumbo was alright but unremarkable. The food also came out extremely quickly making me think most of it is prepped in bulk in advance rather than made to order. I would've given them 4 stars just for the  oysters, but unfortunately the Pecan Cobbler dessert (served in a Martini glass? as if they tried to make a cobbler but failed in consistency which resulted in wet sloppy super sweet sugar bits) left much to be desired. I would pass on the dessert here and maybe grab a drink in the bustling French Quarter instead! Additionally, the service was exceptionally terrible (waiter didn't even look at us or speak to us other than to ask what we wanted to order, even when placing and taking away the $100+ check on our table). I'd consider coming again just for a quick order of oysters and a seat at the bar.","date":1623113742000}

It was cold, 40something degrees and I was not dressed for the weather. My husband and I pointed out all sorts of nearby places that didn't have a line but they were adamant, it was Acme or bust. So we waited for about 45 minutes while I plotted grabbing a trash can and starting a fire to un-numb my hands. We were finally seated and ordered two dozen charbroiled oysters for an appetizer for the table.  \n\nThey were good, don't get me wrong. On bread with a bit of the green Tabasco sauce? I actually enjoyed oysters for the first time in my life. Now, were they worth freezing my butt off for 45 minutes? Hell no. \n\nI followed them up with the New Orleans Medley platter which contained red beans and rice, gumbo, jambalaya, and sausage. It was all very tasty (the jambalaya especially so) and the bread pudding desert was rich and delicious. \n\nIf you're a huge oyster person, I recommend giving Acme a shot.

Let me say, this was by far the worst, least friendliest place we've been to in a very long time. We got there at 4:00 on a Sunday afternoon, when there was no wait outside. So as we started to open the front door of the restaurant to enter, a staff member bolted out of her chair and barred the entrance! She stated we \"had to stand in line\". Now, picture this: it's about 100 degrees, 100% humidity, there is no one in sight on the street, but she pointed to the roped off \"line\" and told us to stand there. We waited about 5 minutes, ready to storm off, when she stuck her head out and told us we could come in but they only had space at the bar. There were many empty tables---especially in the back---but we took her word for it and headed to the two stools she pointed out...which were right next to the nastiest smelling garbage cans where the staff dumps all the refuse. When we asked for another place, she snapped that nothing else was available. For real? Luckily, two people further down the bar were just leaving, so we just moved onto their stools, earning us a nasty look from the hostess-with-the-leastest.\n\nWe ordered beer and the oysters, as well as a po boy to share. Good, but not worth the crappy service we endured. Everyone was surly, and they even argued w\/each other. No one seemed to want to be there, and neither did we.","date":1308689420000}

This is one of those places that is a \"must visit\" for tourists like myself so I find myself back here although next time I will give Felix's across the street a try since they both have long lines anyway. The raw oysters here did not impress and I constantly found myself crunching on the shells of the poorly shucked oysters. They were also not washed; had a good amount of black sandy dirt on the outside of the shells making it hard to slurp up the goodness-had to use a fork.\n\nbut the BOO FRIES.. I fell in love instantly. I don't know if that was because it was the first thing I ate that day at 3pm but the gravy thing they had all over the fries was heaven.

Glad I did!  I liked the place much better than Deanie's.  To be honest, I liked this place so much that I came here again for a pure oyster lunch 3 days later.  The fresh oysters are the same level of briny perfection, but the cooked food at Acme's is much better.\n\nWe started with a dozen raw and a dozen grilled.  I agree that the grilled oysters are pretty amazing (especially with a dash of the chipotle Tabasco), but in my book, oysters are best raw.  I'm a substantial eater, my head hurts when I think about how the leader of the Acme Oyster eating club put away 42.5 dozen in an hour.\n\nWe then moved onto the New Orleans Medley (seafood gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice, smoked sausage) and found it pretty tasty.  The gumbo was especially good.  Not quite full, we ordered a Peace Maker po boy.  The fried shrimp and oysters made the sandwich good, but the Tabasco-infused mayo made it excellent.  I thought there was an slight bias towards the shrimp in the mix, but that could just be my love for oysters speaking!\n\nThough stuffed, I couldn't pass up an opportunity to try their Max's banana foster pie.  Drizzled with caramel, it had a cheesecake-like creamy consistency, though taste-wise it lacked the tartness of cream cheese.  I thought it was really good, but was disappointed when I saw the store-bought Hershey's caramel syrup on the counter by the kitchen.  Oh well.\n\nWaits are ridiculously long on weekends, and you have to line up outside so you can't even sit at the bar while waiting.  If you come for lunch on a weekday though, you can waltz right in and have your pick of tables.  Delicious.","date":1243623153000}

After getting their, we had to wait in line for probably 15 minutes (seems like this place always as a line, but seems to move relatively quickly). Most of the tables are family style, so don't be surprised if you are sitting at a table with others. The menu contains the full spread of Louisiana cuisine from crawfish and oysters to Po-boys and smoked sausage. We started our meal with a dozen raw oysters, half dozen chargilled oysters and an order of the crawfish hush puppies. The raw oysters were large and extremely fresh. The crawfish hush puppies were perfectly crisp on the outside with melt-in-your mouth crawfish filling. The chargrilled oysters were out-of-this world with the oyster sitting in its own juices mixed with a garlic butter sauce and topped with melted romano cheese. For entrees, we got the deep-fried crawfish Po-boy, the Variety Plate (with samplings of gumbo, jambalaya, smoked sausage, and red beans on rice), and the crawfish etoufee. The entrees were good, not the best but good. What surprised me was the somewhat mediocre quantities for the amount of money they were charging. Service was ok, as were the entrees. The appetizers were the best part of the meal. I definitely suggest dinning hear once to say that you did, but there are much better and more reasonably priced eateries all around New Orleans.","date":1375409996000}

The catfish tails were tasty and the dipping sauce was fantastic!! We also took the oyster shooters, which is an experience everyone must have. It's a vodka shot with Tabasco sauce and the oyster that really gets into your nose of taken right. Their Moscow mule was also good, which, in my book, defines a good bar menu!\n\n2. The rest - I give this place a 3 because of their policy for groups. One friend came in late and they refused to allow her to sit with us or order food with us. She had to get through the line to do that, which was irritating. We were at a 4 people table and not even halfway through our meal and we were ordering more things as she came. After talking to the manager, she was \"allowed\" to sit with us, but couldn't order!

We then had Chicken Andouille Gumbo, and Seafood platter. Had a few tarters with the shrimp. Oysters, and catfish. For me good tarter is a must if you are eating fried seafood. All was great but really the gumbo and seafood are just good when compared to how great Oysters were.  As we were leaving I noticed the line was at now at about 40 and I have to say that I would without question stand in that line again just for the chargrilled oysters. Enjoy!","date":1254805584000}

Listen here, when you have prominent, well known entertainers trying to eat at your place, treat them with respect.

Only because the name of this establishment is highly recommended by people who enjoy chicken fingers and fried potato sticks.\n\nTwo of my friends were there and I was super famished. They've sent me an invite, so why not right?\n\nChar Grilled Oysters:     Right when I arrived the char grilled oysters have just touched down on the table. We smashed em family style. One thing I love about this platter of oysters is the butter sauce. The blend of spices and garlic is just sublime. I could eat these things all day.\n\nBoo Fries:     Also known as the Poutine of the south. The ones served here is pretty good, but I'm a Detroiter,, my close proximity to Canada has turned me into a poutine snoot. Not really up to par.\n\nNew Orleans Medley:     Gumbo was good, red beans and rice was strong AF, Jambalaya is winning and the sausage was ok.\n\nShrimp Po Boi:     Bread was fresh, crusty and chewy, the shrimp was nicely seasoned and the fixins was on point. Except I swear I ordered fish instead became shrimp.\n\nOver all a pretty good place to eat. Pretty good food, I would totally eat here again. Probably still wouldnt be my first choice.

We waited on a Sunday night for at least 45 minutes in the queue outside, but it being NOLA, most people were sipping on beers bought at nearby bars while they waited, so if you have a drink and a chat with the people next to you, the time flies!  We sat at the bar, because other people wanted to wait for a table, and we got seated faster.  Why not sit at the bar?  You can watch the game on TV, talk to the bartender, and eat the same tasty food.  Win-win.\n\nWe had a meal of chargrilled oysters, the New Orleans Medley (gumbo, jambalaya, red beans\/rice, grilled smoked sausage), and a 1\/2-1\/2 platter with fried shrimp, fried fish, french fries, and cole slaw.  WOW.  This is the kind of food we'd been dreaming of before our trip!  We stuffed ourselves.  First, the chargrilled oysters are fabulous.  We got them somewhere else later and they were gross and smothered in cheese and sauce.  If you get them here, they are a much more subtle version and you can still taste the oyster.  They are savory and hearty and delicious.  All the fried fish had an absolutely perfect crispy outside batter, and the gumbo was gorgeous and smoky.  I don't think I'd ever had proper gumbo once in my life, and  we were both blown away.  We enjoyed everything else too, but the fried seafood, gumbo, and chargrilled oysters were massive, unmissable highlights.  \n\nService at the bar was a bit slow (shall we say, relaxed?)

Fifty minutes later we finally made our way in, just as they were getting ready to close. Lol. Service was still fantastic though, and I really have to commend our waiter's impeccable service and friendly and sociable demeanor, despite how late it was and how close they were to closing for the evening.\n\nAs for the food, I was a little less impressed. I ordered a half-turkey po boy with a side of hush puppies. It was my first time trying hush puppies and they weren't bad but I didn't love them either. My friend tried them and said usually they're supposed to be more savory, and the hush puppies here were sweeter than she was expecting. My po-boy wasn't bad but again I wasn't in love with it either. And as for the bread pudding, it was good but it came out room temperature. I really wish it had been hotter temperature-wise, as I know the bread pudding would have been delicious if that was the case. \n\nYet despite the average meal, as I mentioned the service was astounding.

We came on a Saturday around 5:00pm and the line was already pretty long, we waited about 30-40 minutes for a group of 9.  \n\nThey say you can order drinks at the bar while waiting so we went to Bourbon House to get the Frozen Bourbon Milk Punch (which was really good) while waiting.\n\nATMOSPHERE:  There is a smaller area in the very front and then as you go further there are more tables in the back.  We sat at one long table near the restrooms.  It's pretty dark inside with TVs all over the place and kind of feels like buca di bepo to me.\n\nFOOD: We got a dozen raw oysters and a dozen charboiled.  The Charboiled oysters are cooked and come with a ton of cheese and garlic on them.  They weren't bad but I could only imagine eating a few before getting OD'd.  The raw oysters were pretty fresh and tasty and were about $1 each.\n\nI wanted to get the sampler but ended up sharing with 2 others and got the jambalaya, gumbo, and red beans and rice.  The jambalaya also comes with a fried softshell crab.\n\nJambalaya - was kind of dry and not that flavorful.\n\nGumbo - was probably the better of the three but also not that flavorful.  Overall, wasnt impressive.\n\nRed Beans and Rice - heard a lot about these dishes but it just tasted like refried beans and rice.  The sausage it comes with was OK.\n\nThe softshell crab only comes with the dish so you cant order it on its own.  It was decent again, but the coating was not that crispy.\n\nMy friends also got the crawfish, which looked good so maybe just stick to the seafood if you come.","date":1433362112000}

We were feed and entertained by our shucker, 'Majik' who joked and told us stories of New Orleans all night.\n\nI started off with a serving of grilled oysters while my wife had a serving of raw oysters. The grilled oysters were plump, tender and delicious! The raw oysters were very fresh and plump. We sat and ate and went through 4 dozens oysters before we had our full. To finish our meal we had 'Oyster Shots'. They plop a oyster in a shot glass, throw in a little Bloody Mary and top it off with a shot of vodka. At a $1.50 a shot it's a bargain!\n\nDon't look for any 'surf and turf' meals here. The place carters only Oysters, Shrimp, Catfish, Crawfish tails, Oyster and shrimp po-boys. You'll only find one red meat item on the menu - their 1\/4 lb Hamburger. But for that you can go anywhere and have a hamburger. \n\nWhen in New Orleans, if you go for Mardi Gras or not, stop by the Acme Oyster House and get your seafood fetish on!

I was introduced to a real Cajun dinner by a friend of ours mother and when the first dish came out it looked like an eyeball in black tar. The father of our friend roared and said I think you put too much pepper in that hot sauce. The mother said, no I think I did not, I think it's fine. I had a moment of decision, whether I would chew it or just swallow it whole so that I wouldn't spit it out. I put the raw oyster smothered in black tar in my mouth and swallowed it. Steam came out of my ears and I was in tears. The father roared -I told you mama that you put too much pepper in that hot sauce for those boys. The reason I am telling you the story is because of that incident, I avoided like the plague going to the Acme Oyster House even though my friends went every time I came to New Orleans.\n\nI discovered how great oysters are three years ago and now my local friends have been taking me to every oyster bar so I could have oysters every way humanly possible. I came by myself to Acme and sat at the bar and ordered a half dozen charbroiled oysters. They were plump and filled with cheese and garlic. I tried to eat them slowly and savor each oyster and the marvelous flavors emanating from each half shell. I had a wonderful conversation with the bar server between his shucking of the large oysters.

My wife had never been to NOLA and I was determined to show her a good time. We ate and drank our way through the city in three days. When we arrived to New Orleans I decided to take her to a New Orleans staple and show her a tried-and-true New Orleans dining experience. So when we got there the line was long, as expected. The street smelled of sewage, as expected, And the people were drinking in the street and ready to eat and party, duh! But experiencing all of this was experiencing the essence of the French Quarter. Once we got seated we order probably one of our single favorite dishes that we ate the entire trip. The Char-grilled Oysters. Holy smokes they are delicious! Grilled oysters topped with cheese and lemon served pipping hot. The oysters are taste fresh and the cheese smooths out the flavor of the oyster. You cant go wrong with these oysters. I went with with the 1\/2 and 1\/2 platter for dinner and I must say that fried platter was great. I went with the shrimp and fried fish and I could barely finish the platter. \n\nSo there may be slightly better places in New Orleans to get seafood. But there are few places that give you not only great food but also that New Orleans\/French Quarter atmosphere that invites you to prepare your mind to experience the great city of New Orleans.

If you want fresh, meaty gulf oysters, shucked right before your eyes, Acme Oyster House is the place for you. Of course, the physician in me is obligated to tell you that there is a risk associated with consuming raw oysters, and if you have chronic illness of the liver, stomach, blood, or have immune disorders, you are at greater risk of serious illness from raw oysters. BUT, if that's the case, Acme Oyster house has you covered too, with their fully cooked, char-grilled oysters.

One of the destinations that we were most excited about was the Acme Oyster House.   One of my brothers has been to the city a number of times and told me it's his favorite place.  \n\nFIRST THE BAD PART (the hostess = 0 stars if possible) \nI must say, our experience at ACME started off very poorly though, not at the fault of the business but solely by the actions of the power-hungry hostess with attitude.  She (a middle aged African American woman) insisted we wait outside, even though it was extremely cold and raining.  Then once she finally sat us, she sat us at a table next to the door that was freezing whenever the door opened.  So, we spoke with young man about sitting somewhere else.  When he went to look in the back of the restaurant for an available table, the power-hungry hostess with attitude got way too (over the top) upset about it and said \"I am the hostess and will sit you\" then made us go back outside again into the cold!!  At that point I ready to leave, but my fiance' convinced me to stay a few more minutes.  About 5 to 7 minutes later (outside in the cold rain) the hostess with attitude then told us we could come back in and she sat us a shared table next two three women.  At that point were just happy to be out of the cold rain and not be sitting by the door.   \n\nNOW THE GOOD PART (Acme Oyster House Food is the Best!! 5 Stars)\nWe ordered two dozen of the chargrilled oysters, along with a PoBoy sandwhich.  I must say their chargrilled oysters were my absolute favorite thing that we ate in the French Quarter.  \n\nIN CONCLUSION:  If it were not for the entirely AWFUL experience we had with that rude hostess, this would have easily been a 5 star review.  \n\nMy advice to ACME managment... put that hostess in check because she is the first impression people are getting when they walk in your door.","date":1544643478000}

Their fish batter has secret spices in it (they won't tell you, I tried), giving it a cajun kick that contrasts nicely with their house tartar sauce.\n\nAnd their oysters were SO fresh and SO clean **Outkast plays in background** I normally dont eat oysters because even the slightest fishy taste or grit in the oyster grosses me out. But theirs are served on a bed of ice, and as clean and fresh as they come. I also really liked their gumbo and red beans and rice.\n\nOur server even came and sat down with us to chat for a minute.

However, someone comes out to ask your party size and if you're lucky enough to be a party of 2, there's a good chance you'll get seated immediately. You may have to share a long table with other couples, which is completely fine by me as long as I'm that much closer to putting food in my mouth. \n\nThe interior is pretty small, and feels even more so because the lighting is dim. The restaurant is basically a long and narrow dining room that can feel a bit crowded with so many patrons and all the waiters moving briskly about. \n\nWe ordered half dozen raw oysters (fresh and pretty big sized), half dozen chargrilled oysters, which were covered in garlic and Parmesan (also very good, but not as good as the southwest chargrilled oysters at Mr. Ed's), shared the 2 soft shell crab entree with fries and coleslaw.

We waited about 30-40 minutes to get seated and there were several tables near us empty and several seats at the bar available.

I'm sure you're thinking, this place is absolutely touristy but in actuality, this place was BOMB. The wait is worth it. Actually, to make you feel better, the host is so organized that she will come out of the restaurant walk down the line in the cold and will write your names down, the number in your party, and which table seating you would prefer. Because she does all that, you maybe 10 up but if there is a table for 2 that is available NOW, you save like 25 minutes! So we really only waited like 30 minutes instead of the infamous \"hour wait\". Acme is located one block of Bourbon st. So what I suggest to do is make your wife or someone weaker than you wait in line and you go to a bar near by, meander your way through the crowd, get some beers and bring it back in line because in New Orleans you can drink on the street. Time flew so fast and the southern hospitality of the people in line really creates great company while waiting. The food was absolutely delicious. Everything you imagined this place served, they made for us. Softshell crab, charbroiled oysters, crab legs....fries. They also served PURPLE HAZE beer which is basically purple drink in beer form.

I had read about Acme on a number of lists so this sounded good to us. We waited outside at 1:45 p.m. for about 15 minutes before we were seated at the bar. It's always fun to sit at the bar because you can chat with the bartenders and oyster shuckers - who are generally really entertaining. This was certainly the case here. \n\nWe kept it simple - po'boys. Mine, a shrimp, and my husband's, a fried oyster. They were... fine? I don't really understand the madness behind the po'boy. There's hardly any flavor. It's just... fried. The shrimp was really well cooked. There's something less tasty about a fried oyster though. It feels like you're ruining the integrity of the meat. All in all, I think that this is what a po'boy is supposed to taste like so I won't dock them for that. \n\nWhat I will dock this place for is that it just feels... dirty. Right next to my husband's seat was a trash can where the waitstaff kept throwing away food from people's plates! This is disgusting. Keep the trash in the back, away from your patrons. Why would you be throwing away food literally one foot from someone who is trying to eat? Based off this alone, I would not come back here.

I do not wait in a long line for any restaurant but Acme is the only exception to the rule. I have visited Acme three times now and each time I waited in line that was 30 to 45 minute wait. During Memorial Day weekend visit, this place was one of the few that was still serving boiled crawfish by the pound.  The crawfish were spiced right with Cajun flavors and very succulent. The Chargrilled and Raw oysters were fresh and not gritty. One of the best Chargrilled oysters here.  I agree with my friend Cheri Y to skip the Po'boys. Not only is the bread hard to chew but the 'dressing' doesn't add any real flavor to the sandwich. The service is slow which is expected at this busy establishment.

The wait is ALWAYS between 20-45mins so don't be surprise. It moves pretty fast. Small groups moves faster than larger groups for sure. OYSTERS here is the highlight. Raw or Chargrilled is good. Today the raw oysters were about 2-3ins big and super fat and pump!! Only $15-$16 for 1 dozen. What a steal! People these aren't gourmet oysters that you go too for high end restaurants were they are $3-$4 a piece but these are gulf oysters...sweet fat and juicy. So if you're looking for affordable oysters with great quality for the price then come here! The chargrilled is usually a hit or miss but today it was perfect. Finger licking good. They have crawfish when it's in season and it's not the \"Asian\" saucy type but it's the straight Cajun soak in meat flavor. I love it here. The size was definitely large to jumbo and it's only early march. We've tried other stuff here like their po-boys and gumbo and wasn't impressed.

My friend wanted jambalaya and we got that along with some gumbo and oyster shooters. The jambalaya and gumbo were good but not out of the world amazing. A tad bit too salty for me. The oyster shooters were strong (maybe we should've mixed them better). \n\nAfter we ate here I met up with Angela C and read her review for the Metairie location... I will jump on her bandwagon and STRONGLY recommend the chargrilled oysters. When my friend and I were perusing the menu, I said \"Ew, I don't want to eat cooked oysters\" when I saw the chargrilled item. I bite my tongue. As Angela later described to me in person, as I was salivating, the oysters are shucked and placed on the grill in its half shell and then some delicious things are placed on top of the hot oyster, French escargot style (which I also LOVE). The chargrilled comes in 1\/2 dozen or a dozen. The 1\/2 dozen was more than enough for me...\n\nBut, that did not stop me from ordering the 'peace maker' fried shrimp and oyster po boy. This was my last stop before the airport and I needed to maximize my NOLA food intake. The peacemaker is huge. Angela and I shared one. Its hefty height makes eating messy. I like the tabasco-infused mayo and the oysters here are so fat and juicy! Also recommend. \n\nDon't come here if you're looking for something healthy. A lady sat next to me and asked the bartender if they had steamed veggies or salad. \"Is cole slaw salad?\"\n\nI will mention that the two times I came here during the late weekend afternoons, I went straight for the bar.

They seem to do a good job getting people in - they have a good system going. Our waiter was great and friendly! I've only rated this place three stars because of the massive amount of shells in the oysters. We ordered both raw and grilled oysters. We were pulling shell fragments out of our mouths that were surprisingly large. Eventually we just started inspecting all the oysters closely to pull out any shells we found, but a lot of the time we were still getting them. They are HORRIBLE at shucking oysters which I found surprising given all the great reviews. The bad thing is that the grilled oysters had the shells pieces cooked in under the cheese, so they were impossible to see until you start chewing and realize there's something hard and crunchy in your mouth. The raw oyster shells themselves were filthy and our napkins were black by the time we finished eating them. My husband absolutely loves oysters and we get them wherever they're served, and this was by far the worst place we've had oysters. \n\nIf our server, Will, wasn't so great this place definitely would not have gotten three stars.","date":1490791808000}

We decided that this was the place we wanted to try while in New Orleans, so we waited our time. 15 minutes had passed after we asked the host how much time did she think was left. She responded unsure and said possibly another 25 minutes. IMMEDIATELY, after she says that 3 people out of our party of 7 walked away from the line to use a porter potty outside because a friend could not hold her bladder any longer. A friend that stayed in line calls us back through phone to tells us to hurry and walk back since we were being seated faster than expected (not even 2 minutes have passed since she said we were probably going to wait for another 25 minutes). \n\nWe walk back and and notice our friends are seated by the door so we join them. The manager immediately walks over and asks the group \"where did you all come from\"? My friends and I thought it was a joke and he was just starting conversation, but we were mistaken. He asked us once more \"no, seriously, where did you guys come from?\" So, we responded that we just walked back from the restroom and he began to tell us that there are no restrooms outside (there are) and us walking away was unfair for the other guests that have been waiting in line all night. We explained that we have been waiting in line JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.\n\nThe craziest part is, we called the host over to back us up because she was outside with us and saw us the entire time. When I asked her if she come over and speak to the manager and be our witness she said okay and that it was no problem. She walked over with me and when she began to speak and tell the manager that we left to use the restroom and actually waited our time in line...THE MANAGER SAID \"walk away, I got this\". ???? That was unbelievable and disrespectful. He treats his staff and guests like crap, clearly. \n\nTo make a long story short, the manager said we needed to leave after we continued to tell him that everything he was saying was wrong and unfair to us because we waited outside in the cold and he made all the attention on us as if we were animals that shouldn't be there. \n\nThe manager of this restaurant, SCOTT SCHICK, is atrocious.","date":1487559063000}

Same goes for the shrimp and oyster po boy.  The fresh oysters are also the thing to get when you go there.  The guys that shuck the oysters over the bar counter are like machines, cranking out plenty more nice briny bites.\n\nThe place was so good, we decided to go there a second time.

I guess it was featured in Man v. Food.  I just like oysters so anything with \"oyster\" in the name sounds good to me.  Here's a list of my eatings:\n\nChargrilled oysters:  A New Orleans classic.  So garlicky and buttery, served with bread.  I prefer raw oysters but these were pretty darn tasty.  I was happy splitting only a half dozen of these.\n\nOysters on the half shell:  So fresh!  I do prefer Pacific Northwest oysters over gulf oysters, but these little puppies were pretty fresh and a good price.  I was quite happy with them.  I would've downed a whole dozen myself but I had to be nice and share :-P.\n\nPeacemaker Po Boy:  This was recommended by the waiter.  Fried shrimp and oyster in a Po Boy.  It also had some spicy mayo which gave it a little kick.  Quite an enjoyable sandwich.\n\nOur waiter was pretty hilarious.  He was so stoked about the upcoming Superman movie and wouldn't stop talking about it.  Made our night even better.\n\nOverall:  Definitely a gem in New Orleans.  Fresh oysters, delicious po boys, and friendly southern hospitality.  I would come back again!","date":1352063508000}

In a single day, we lunched at Willie Mae's and Mother's, snacked at Cafe du Monde, ate full three-course dinners at Commander's Palace, then rolled into Acme Oyster House, deeply satisfied but with room for more.\n\nWe ordered a dozen raw, half a dozen chargrilled, and two shooters for me and the pops.  A couple of Blue Moons also made their way onto the table.  Despite the crammed status of my stomach, I found the oysters delicious.  I would skip the shooters unless I just wanted to drink - they contained a frightful amount of vodka to still qualify as food.  The raw oysters were great quality, especially for the price, and the chargrilled version doused in garlic butter and grated romano cheese was blissful.  Then again, I think boogers would taste good swamped with butter and cheese.\n\nThe vibe was very cool, kind of laid-back with a judicious use of neon.  I enjoyed the Wall of Fame displaying the \"15 Dozen Club,\" which I really think I could join if I felt like making myself sick one day.  TV screens showed the World Series of Poker, which is always a plus.

Tender and tasting of clean ocean, 12 were just not enough for he three of us. Still- we curbed our desire so we would have room for our main course. Must also mention that 5$ a glass Chardonnay was reasonable. \n     We got the shrimp platter and the fried shrimp was fresh, hot, crispy and delicious. Only downside was no sauce available other than ketchup. Ugh! I got the Boo fries which were a take on poutine and the gravy was out of this world. \n      Our final choice was the hamburger PoBoy medium rare plus cheese which was a good burger. \n      Our server was awesome and had waited 4 years to get hired there because no one ever leaves.

Since the wait is usually very long, we would always like to make our wait well worth..here is a list of things we ordered for my boyfriend and myself just the two of us: 2 pounds of boiled crawfish; 1 dozen of fresh oyster; 2 dozens of char-grilled oyster; one pull-boy; one Jambalaya; one gumbo; and one rootbeer float. And yes, we finished them all in no time, so you should know how amazing they are! \n\nSince lots of people have commented on the oysters and the pull-boys, I feel obligated to say something about the rootbeer float, definitely the best rootbear float I have ever had in my life, and it goes so well with the spiciness of the cajun food.  \n\nI still dream about their char-grilled oysters and hope one day I will be able to find something comparable in Los Angeles....So far, none of the places that claim they can do char-grilled oysters have come even close to what I have had in ACME.

We stumbled onto this place after one of my friends from CA read the reviews. She is a seafood person and really loves oysters and crawfish. \n\nWhile waiting outside, the waiters would come out and ask if anyone wants to sit at the bar. Seeing how it's all the same, and you get the same services, if not more attention, we decided to skip the line and head to the bar. \n\nUpon sitting down, we looked at the menu's and noticed the prices of the oysters. Just to be clear, I do not eat oysters, so I would know nothing about them. My friend on the other hand, she's an oyster maniac. She gushed about the prices of the oysters and how affordable (and reasonably cheap compared to CA). We ordered a dozen Fresh, Ice Cold oysters and half a dozen Chargrilled Oysters. We also ordered the New Orleans Medley and the Acme \"10 Napkin Roast Beef\" po-boy sandwich. \n\nOnce again, to emphasize, I do not eat oysters. When the dozen raw cold, gray, weird looking, yet fresh (described by my friend) came out, I did not want to touch it. Therefore I can not comment on that. But in the words of my friend, \"They were DELICIOUS!\" She said she would recommend them for all the oysters eaters out there. \n\nThe Chargrilled Oysters on the other hand, that I could eat. I tried one of them, and they were DELICIOUS as well. This coming from one who does not eat oysters. They were flavored with seasonings and had some cheese melted onto the shells. This I would recommend, probably the dozen or so. But I believe that oysters are better eaten raw. \n\nThe New Orleans Medley was what you expect in New Orleans. It had the gumbo and jambalaya, as well as beans and a sausage. All 3 of us sampled into each portion. The seafood gumbo was decent. Really watery, which I was told that is not how real gumbo should be (someone please clarify for me). The jambalaya was really good. It was well prepared and is what you would expect as jambalaya. \n\nThe Acme \"10 Napkin Roast Beef\" po-boy sandwich is fairly large, so be careful. We all divvied it up and their responses were \"This is really good\" and \"Soft and tender\". I would have to agree with them. This was my main course, as I do not eat raw oysters, so a portion of that was allocated to the remaining two. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place. One would have to either get here during off hours to miss the line, or just request for the bar seats. Either way, a good place to eat in New Orleans.","date":1249914174000}

The worse part about this was being stuck in line with filthy smokers with nowhere to get away from it.  My eyes were stinging from having smoke blown in my face by the time I got inside.\n\nTo reduce the wait, sign up for \"first available seating\" which means you'll either be at a table or at the bar.\n\nThe seating that we ended up with was cafeteria style - a table for 6, with 3 different groups of 2 seated at it.\n\nWe started by sharing a dozen of the chargrilled oysters.  They were delicious - and I don't even really like oysters.  They were sprinkled with butter and parmesan, then cooked.  They were served with a few pieces of bread.  Very good.\n\nI also got the New Orleans Medley - a sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice and smoked sausage.  I really enjoyed the jambalya.  The red beans and rice were just ok, as was the smoked sausage.  I didn't enjoy the seafood gumbo that much, but I'm not a huge seafood fan.  I probably would have enjoyed the chicken gumbo more.\n\nOverall, I'd rate the oysters 5 stars.  It's the food in the name and obviously the house specialty.

Definitely a place that stays busy with a line down the block but once you're seated the experience begins. The charbroiled oysters are pretty much one of the best things I've ever eat in my life and I've been a professional chef for the past 12 years of my life. I had the fried seafood platter oyster shrimp and fish they were all pretty good. Prices aren't crazy but you may be tempted to order another round of oysters once you try them.

I got seated at the shucking bar on the right.  The restaurant itself is casual, divey, loud, and almost obnoxiously neon-lit, although underneath that, you can see some classic decor.\n\nWent with half dozen raw oysters on the half-shell and half dozen chargrilled oysters, which I haven't had before.  I got 7 of each (not sure how that works out to be a half-dozen).  The raw oysters were big and plump looking, accompanied by simple cocktail sauce and lemon wedges.  Although fresh and good texture, I was entirely unimpressed with the taste; I'm no oyster connoisseur but I've had my share of both West and East coast oysters in many places and these just lacked flavor of any kind, very bland.  The chargrilled oysters, on the other hand, were a surprise.  Topped with garlicky melted butter and cheese, they were cooked through but still juicy, a bit of smoky flavor, and enriched by the sauce.  Never had anything like it and really enjoyed that.  Another Abita (what else?), the amber, to wash down the oysters.\n\nWould skip the raw oysters, may not be a fan of Gulf oysters, but the chargrilled are worth having.","date":1323405227000}

Not really sure how clean it is (guessing not very by the look of the bathrooms) and the service, as is everything within walking distance or bourbon street was terrible. I went 30 minutes without having a refill. They also sit you at community tables, which is fine, but I did not expect it.","date":1437368538000}

The service is faster..and you wanna get your food fast here trust me. \n\nI'm chatting with other folks in the line for about 5 minutes and my name is called. I have a seat at the bar, greetings all around, place my appetizer\/drink order and begin to soak it all in. Acme is not big at all but somehow I thought it was. Long bar along the left wall, several tables with chairs on the right. Big screen tv's with various games on..I'm watching the FIFA Cup Series. When I'm dining solo, my strategy is to try everything I want and share. That way I get to sample different items, meet new people and share the love. \n\nI started with sausage\/ chicken jambalaya. It was divine! Taste lime the one my cousin makes..not too spicy, no tomatoes that I can see. Color was a dirty brown, plump rice with bits of sausage and green onion every so often. Next came the oysters. You have got to try these. Fresh, juicy oysters cooked in the half shell with butter, wine topped with a crunchy parmesean cheese crust...dead. sop up some of that sauce with a piece of bread and ohhhhh!  I happily shared with the guy next to me and he polished them off with the same feelings of ohhhhh that I had. \n\nFinally, my po boy came in all its glory. Let me just say they are more than generous with the seafood. Lightly breaded oysters and shrimp perfectly fried, crisp lettuce, between a soft Italian bread bun. Mmmm.. it was heaven! Then the spicy Tabasco mayo gets in on the action and amps up the flavor of the whole sandwich. So good!  I couldn't eat it all but I stuffed those last 2 oysters in my belly. Couldn't let those puppies go to waste. \n\nSo for 1 beer, cup of jambalaya, 1\/2 doz of grilled oysters and a po boy my total came up to $34. Not bad at all.

If you're on the fence about whether to go or not: JUST GO. Aceme is a French Quarter institution serving up amazing chargrilled oysters. Smoky, salty, buttery, charred, these morsels are wonderful. On the greasy side, but it's possible to eat the oyster flesh without sucking down the melted butter. The crayfish hushpuppies are also delicious - just the right amount of seafood, sweet cornbread and fried outer crunch. Definitely the most outstanding part of the night was the fried catfish, though. This piece of fish was AMAZING - true southern style, not greasy, tender, with that classic southern cornmeal coating. Haven't had it better except by some parents of a friend of mine - an elderly couple from Louisiana frying their \"family catfish recipe\" up at home! The house special poy boy had great fried oysters and shrimp, but the touch bread and messy fillings made the entire experience lackluster. If I could re-do that experience, I'd just empty out the fried goods and eat those only.\n\nDecor here is really laid back, as is the dining area with paper mats and basically anything goes.

I don't like oysters, seafood, or anything of that nature.  I came to this restaurant because I was with 6 seafood lovers (we were in a group of 7).\n\nTaste:\nI got the chicken sandwich.  It was DRY.  Check my other reviews for food that I had in NOLA, there are much better chicken sandwiches in the area.  There was no seasoning on the sandwich, just tasted like grilled chicken and bread.  I asked for lettuce, never got that.  It was edible, but that is pretty much all I can say about the meal.\n\nAlso it had a seafood after taste (YUCK as an on-seafood eater).\n\nI will say that my 6 seafood lovers companions LOVED the craw fish and oysters here.  I posted a photo of one.\n\nValue:\nThe sandwich came ala carte, so the sweet potato fries I wanted on the side were more.  I received far too little for the cost, it should come with the sandwich for these prices.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe place was dark and dirty.  I couldn't tell it was dimly lit with neon and half working bulbs in to create an effect or hide the dirt.  The tables had that picnic style checkerboard look that was just tacky to me.\n\nThis place was overall dirty, probably due to the nature of the food, but still they need to keep the place is cleaner conditions.  I am not from NO and noticed a lot of places are dirtier but this place needs to keep a higher standard with the amount of in-out traffic that goes on here.\n\nBathroom:\nThe bathrooms also felt dirty.  They didn't have paper towels in order to leave the place, you had to touch the door handle.  All the employees that went into the bathroom had washed their hands which was nice, but they all touched that dirty door handle on the way out.  They had Dyson hand blowers.\n\nHospitality:\nI didn't expect VIP treatment because of how large our party was, plus we didn't know anyone that had an in or anything but being outside in the cold was pretty annoying.  They need a waiting room of some sort.\n\nI think I got one water refill all meal.  The waiter seemed snarky with me (maybe because I wasn't getting seafood) or made his life difficult because I got something so plain; I don't know. I didn't bother or complain to him all meal.\n\nThe server also messed up on our order and looked pissed when he had to take it back.  WE didn't mess up, YOU did.  Pretty annoying when he tries to place blame on us, he did not try charging us for it though, it wasn't on the final bill.\n\nBottom Line:\nEven if all your travel buddies want to go here you're better off going somewhere else as a non-seafood eater.  They loved their meal, but did complain about the service as well.  All my buddies said they would come back, I will not be coming back.","date":1582758653000}

The food was edible, but nothing spectacular. The bill was $96 for an appetizer, a dozen raw, a poboy, a order of crab cakes, and two teas. That was with tip. The oysters were sad with most being slightly larger than a quarter and two being only about 1 1\/2 that size, when we shuck at home, this size gets used for sandwiches, or in dirty rice and such. It's still oyster season in lousiana and oysters this size, well they should be ashamed. The crab cakes were not made with lump crab meat but appear to be made with #2 meat, that's what the processor can get out of the carcass after they have removed the better lump meat. The crab claw appetizer wasn't awful but $12.99 for 10 claws is a little on the high side. They claim the peacemaker was voted the #4 poboy in new orleans, well it must have been by the staff, it to was underwhelming and I can think of at least 20 that are better. We thought about the fish and when we asked our waitress, she only knew the name and built it up by saying it was similar to catfish, well it's called Swai, which is actually Asian Catfish from Vietnam. About $2 dollars a pound wholesale! You got two filets for $18 with a vegetable medley.  When we asked the waitress if the fish was just asian catfish she gave in and admitted that they weren't allowed to give that information out. It's obvious that Acme is getting by on its former reputation and is all about maximizing profit using the cheapest ingredients they can find even if it means using foreign sourced seafood. It's sad that things are getting so bad in the sportsmen's paradise that this low end seafood restuarant is considered by anyone to be good.

So, on Sunday morning we were wondering around aimlessly.  Found ourselves on Bourbon St - cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning!!!!!  So, we had a few beers here and then and then headed to Fat Tuesdays for a frozen concoction - then decided to walk and find something to eat as it was getting about lunch time.  So, we stumbled upon Acme Oyster House along with just about everyone else that was awake on the sleepy Sunday in New Orleans.  There was a line about 20 deep.  There was a girl with a clipboard - she take your name, just the number in your party.  It was a little confusing but that could have been my frozen concoction kicking in - we were finally to the front of the line and the girl with the clip board was a total buzz kill when she informed me I had to ditch my frozen concoction!!! BOO!!!  Upon  entering I wanted out immediately - very small space tables right on top of each other, awful service.  Our waitress had way too many tables to be able to keep up.  We got our drinks after our entrees.  I ordered the New Orleans Medley - a sampling of Gumbo, Jambalaya,\nSmoked Sausage and Red Beans and Rice.  It was all ok.  Maybe I should have had the oysters instead.","date":1206744221000}

Expect a line outside the door, as you usually have to wait before getting in unless you arrive early. However, if you are a smaller party (we were only 2) you may be offered a bar seat and get to skip some of the larger groups in line. This was actually a great accommodation, as sitting at the bar allows you full view of the staff shucking oysters behind the bar-which is quite the spectacle! They have great technique and the amount of oysters they shuck in the time you sit there is unbelievable. We ordered the char-grilled oysters and a bowl of jambalaya. The food arrived very quickly and was quite good! The jambalaya was delicious and spiced perfectly, and the oysters were a great first experience. They also offer oyster shooters, which we did not try, but looked like a fun choice (fresh oyster in a shot of vodka). The atmosphere is fun and friendly for a late night dinner, although a little loud, and staff was efficient and helpful. This is a high profile restaurant in the area, so check it out if that's what you're looking for. It's worth the experience!","date":1585426220000}

We were seated within 10 minutes and ordered a crap ton of food. Props to the server to remembering everything without writing it down! The interior is very casual with neon signs everywhere (sorry for the very red photos from the neon sign), and the tables are decked out in checkered tablecloth. \n\nThe food came out around the same time, and everything was amazing. Surprisingly, it was the raw oysters that won us over, not the chargrilled. The chargrilled oysters with butter lemon and garlic were amazing, but we actually liked the one at Cochon better because it had more juice whereas this one was more dry. I would dip the bread in the sauce though as it's like butter but better! (pun intended) The raw oysters, on the other hand, were extremely fresh and slightly sweet. Delicious. The oyster shooters has oyster, vodka, and cocktail sauce. One would think this combination would be disgusting, but the cocktail sauce washes out the vodka, so it was actually pretty good! \n\nWe also got the 10 napkin roast beef sandwich which had savory gravy and toppings- the server was super thoughtful and split it into four for our party. The boo fries (meat gravy with cheese) was another savory dish- almost like chili cheese fries but had a richer meat flavor and was less viscous.\n\nOn to the other seafood dishes. The seafood \u00e9touff\u00e9e with rice was very flavorful and rich- another great soup that we devoured. We also got the fried soft shell crab platter with two crabs. Freakin amazing. I don't know what it is with deep fried soft shell crabs and new orleans but... it was so so good. I don't usually like soft shell crab, but I now have hope for myself haha. When it's done well, it is amazing. The fried seafood platter came with oysters, shrimp, fried fish, fries, and coleslaw. Also another great dish. The coleslaw is the best side to get, so I would recommend just getting that and not anything else. It was one of the best I've had as well! \n\nEverything here was so yummy as you can tell..

I'm no oyster connoisseur, but I do distinctly remember having much better oysters this summer in NYC.

He kept the convo going and provided some tips on which stops to hit and where to be a little more vigilant with our surroundings, seeing as we were tourists and all . Nothing wrong with being a tourist - we help the economy, expand our love of culture for that area and as long you're not obnoxious, then we good (don't be that a-hole tourist, anywhere!).  Super friendly service from him and the gals behind the bar. Loved it. Talk about Southern hospitality. \n\nNow on to the stuff we came for: OYSTERS. Let me say WOW. They were a good size that was not overwhelming with right amount of flavor.  Slurped them right up and \"Hollywood if He could\" kept shucking for us. We also had half a dozen of charred oysters. AMAZING and dripping with buttah and melt in your mouth stuff. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. It's THAT good. And the crawdads? Oh my oh my.....such flavor!! AND they were not the puny itsy bitsy little spider ones. No, no.  They were big enough to enjoy. A pound went too easily between us, so we ordered another. I can easily eat cinco pounds in a sitting, however, we wanted to save our tummies and walk and try other places. It was muy bien. \nJust for comparison, on our last day, we hit the place across the street from Acme and we can say the service and food was night and day. Acme knows what they are doing, food taste wise and service. If you sit at the bar, try to sit with Hollywood.

The place is a lot bigger then it looked on tv. When you walk towards the back they have a grill with a glass window so you can watch the cook make their chargrilled oysters with butter and cheese. They looked incredible but we didn't try them. Seemed to be really popular though. Make sure you don't mind being elbow to elbow with people since it's jam packed with people! It does add to the atmosphere I must say. My husband ordered the beans and rice poopa. It was a french bread bowl with beans and rice and a huge sausage link on top. It was delicious. I had the 1\/2 and 1\/2 poboy - fried shrimp and fried oysters. Very good and filing. It doesn't come with any sides but we ordered hushpuppies which were great!!

We then got a little ambitious and ordered some crab cakes, but we had to give up after eating only half. So I'm not 100% sure it wasn't party that we were full, but I'd have to give the crab cakes only 4 stars, because they had too much breading. But even then they were pretty terrific.

Cold brews and cheap oysters, I actually recommend the Chargrilled ones over the raw...\n\n****\n\nOn the day we pulled into the Big Easy and after checking into our nearby hotel we just had to get acclimated and hit up the (in)famous Acme.  Touristy trappings to be expected, but casual, dim, loungy saloon is what first comes to mind.  We wouldn't know just how lucky we were to slide right in and up to a couple of seats at the bar until we saw the daily lines during our stay (I don't know how we managed but it was around 400pm on a Tuesday)...\n\nRaw meaty Louisiana oysters for about $1.50 each is the ticket, washed down with an ice cold Heineken bottle is like a godsend in 90% humidity.  I didn't find them particularly briny in taste but it's the tradeoff for their size, they needed the accompanying lemon and spicy cocktail sauce.  They were pumping out the oysters continuously shucking them as long as we were sitting there at the bar watching them.  Perhaps it's that and that they're so cheap that we got a couple of shells in ours that I have to say they weren't the most masterfully shucked I've ever had.  In sharp contrast, you must have the Chargrilled Oysters as they put the raw ones to shame in taste by comparison.  Being drenched in herb butter and cheese certainly goes a long way,  they even have the presence to serve them with bread so that you can sop up all the sauce.  The Corn and Crab soup of the day was ok and sounded better than it actually was...\n\nGlad we got that out of way when we did because over the next couple of days whenever we walked by, there was a line out the door typically 30 deep.  I was told that this was typical...","date":1467845333000}

There's always a line at Acme, but that's nothing new. It's kind of small inside, so seating is limited. (Felix, across the street, has a huge restaurant, so they're able to seat you immediately and usually the wait for them isn't as long.) I always come alone, so it's a lot easier for me to grab a seat at the bar. This time, they sat me at the far end of the bar (2nd from the last stool) towards the kitchen- big mistake. If you sit at the bar, try to sit near the entrance. My, usually, wonderful experience at Acme was tainted because they sat me near the kitchen- SMELLS LIKE SEWAGE. I wanted to gag!! I've been to NOLA for work about 4 times since, and have not been able to eat here because of the reminder of the sewage smell. (Smell is a powerful memory.)\n\nOverall, food is good so I will give this place another try. But I will have to request to sit at the door, even if there is a long line.

I would never eat a cooked oyster. But after the 30th rave review, my friend (who had similar views on cooked oysters) and I gave in and tried them. Worst case we would flush $10 down the toilet. OH MY GAWD, SO GOOD! So here I am doing what I said I wouldn't do and reviewing the char grilled oysters. Do it, even if you think you don't want to. Because you do.\n\nSecondly, the bloody marys are not as good as everyone says they are. They are drinkable and I had two, but you can get better in the walk-up daiquiri bars on Bourbon & Decatur. It didn't meet the hype.\n\nThirdly, the Roast Beef Debris Po Boy is amazing along with the red beans and rice and ettoufee.  Did not love the gumbo as it was a bit fishy.\n\nLastly, when I Yelp restaurants in unfamiliar areas I find myself always looking for good restaurants in the general vicinity of the ones I was Yelping to help with tomorrow nights dinner destination.

Our gumbo was good, but the grilled oysters were terrible.

The line was long but since I was by myself, I got in within 5 minutes and grabbed a seat at the bar.  Placed my order for a dozen chargrilled oysters and a half and half po boy (oysters and shrimp).  I got a Coke to drink.  Since I was at the bar, I watched the shuckers do their thing.  Pretty impressive stuff.  They place dozens and dozens of oysters on huge trays and get everything prepared.  It kept me entertained while I waited for my food.  \n\nThere were a couple of mix ups during my visit.  The waitress lady first brought out my dozen oysters and sat them down in front of the people next to me.  The shucker quickly pointed out to her that they were mine.  No harm no foul.  This unfortunately wasn't the last situation... They brought out my po boy and I started eating it.  Halfway through, I realized that it was all shrimp and no oysters.  I said fuck it because it was good but what happened was they gave me my neighbors sandwich.  Anyways..........on to the food.\n\nChargrilled Oysters-  5 stars.  Give me 5 dozen of these and watch me go to town.  These were hands down the best thing I ate in New Orleans.  I am headed back in 2 weeks and am going right back to eat some more.  These things were so damn delicious.  Oysters topped with a grip of butter and then sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  They serve them with little rounds of bread so you can sop up the butter and cheese mixture after you are done eating your oysters.  These were AMAZING!  These things were instantly added to my \"last meal on earth\" list.  They were awesome!\n\nShrimp Po Boy-  This thing was alright.  Besides being the wrong thing I ordered, I ate the whole thing and it tasted fine.  I would skip it next time though and get another order of oysters.  \n\nAt the end of my meal, they gave me the check and I noticed that my po boy was not on it.  I should have kept my mouth shut, dropped the cash and then bailed (Karma will bite you in the ass though so I brought it to their attention).  What happened was that earlier when they brought out my sandwich, it was really my neighbors and they never charged me for it...therefore, they never placed an order for mine to begin with.  Anyways....got it all sorted out and paid my bill and left.  \n\nThe chargrilled oysters are not cheap ($19.50 a dozen) but Ill be damned if they weren't one of the greatest things I ever ate and they were WELL worth the cost.

We debated on the grilled oysters but became too full with the platter, so we opted not to try them, a decision that I now regret (I should have at least ordered one!).

It was fries with either pulled pork or pulled beef with gravy and cheese. It was fantastic! \n5. Chargrilled oysters. This was what we waited in line for 45 min for. We were greedy and ordered a dozen and a half (18). It was yummy and the burnt cheese was surprisingly delicious but after a while it just got too salty. \n\nAll in all the food was good. Food came out a little too slow in my opinion. Service was decent. Like others have said, they kind of want to just rush you in and out. But they're definitely still friendly though. I liked it, just don't know if I'd wait 45 min to an hour for it again.","date":1461388316000}

Ever.\n\nMy girlfriends and I visited nola for the first time a few months ago and heard on Yelp that this is the place to go. Thank you fellow Yelpers, for you've done this place justice!\n\nThere was already a line when we got there so I knew this place had to be good. Got seated and our waitress was very nice with recommending us on what to order. Obviously it was an oyster house so we had to at least order some fresh oysters! She also suggested the chargrilled oysters (topped with romano cheese and butter) that everyone seems to love. I had never tried cooked oysters, but I was ready to try on a new little experience and oh my goodness, they were even better than the fresh oysters! They're so delicious that it makes me want to take a road trip back to nola just so I can have more of them.\n\nI also ordered a shrimp poboy. I'm not a fan of mayonnaise that usually comes in the poboy, but for this place I was willing to try their special tabasco mayo. And boy, am I happy I tried it! \n\nOverall, I can't seem to find anything wrong with it. This place has become one of my favorite seafood places of all time and I can't wait to come back to nola one day. This will be my first stop!","date":1311446353000}

The line seemed to move at a decent pace, and we were able to cut a few people ahead of us because we were willing to sit at the bar. Dude, next time I come here, I will specifically request the bar, because watching all that shucking, and being able to chat up the bartender (who is also our server) was hella fun. He was super cool, as was everyone behind the bar. Those people do NOT stop moving. They bust ass! The entire staff that I encountered were actually all really nice. I loved that. \n\nWe started with the chargrilled oysters, and they pretty much changed my life. First of all, if you didn't know, (I didn't) oysters in New Orleans are so freakin big! They were kind of intimidating. The chargrilled ones are served hot (duh) covered in some buttery sauce with cheese... holy mother of whoever you worship... I wanted to shove a dozen in my face. And then maybe a dozen more. And dipping the crusty bread they serve in that butter sauce... AGHHHH (insert crying emoji here). My sister and I ordered oyster shooters (oysters in a shot of vodka) and that was fun. Definitely for the more adventurous. We also ordered the boom boom shrimp, which were deep fried and covered in some sauce that made me feel glad to be alive. lol. I had the oyster and shrimp po boy for my entree. It was really good, but there's a lot of bread there. I feel like too much bread drowns out the taste of the seafood, so I kind of ate it open face. Sorry.

DO NOT GO.\n\nAs a seafood lover, you very well know that Acme Oyster House is on my food bucket list. That is right. I have a food bucket list spreadsheet in my Google Drive - one tab for NYC restaurants and one tab for restaurants outside of NYC in the US. I digress too often. Let's get back to this review.\n\nMy girls and I came to Acme Oyster right after they opened for business on a Saturday. The entire place smelled of puke and floors were pretty sticky.\n\nAnyways, we ordered 1 dozen raw oysters, 1 dozen char broiled, and 3 lbs of craw fish to start.\nFirst to come out were the raw oysters. Excitement ensues! Almost everyone grabbed an oyster to slurp. Our fingers were riddled with dirt, and some of us had dirt on our lips. *Insert vomit face* I looked up at the friend across from me, and she had dirt all over her lips. She didn't even have the chance to eat the oyster; she just kissed it! When the waitress came by, we told her that we didn't like the oysters and wanted to send them back due to the above reason. She was very polite & professional. She took the oysters off of the bill, and shouted to the shuckers that they need to clean their oysters better.\n\nHere is a quick flashback of my life as an intern in the kitchen:\nI, myself, had the lovely job of scrubbing oysters for dinner service before. Grunt work at its finest. If you are not familiar with oyster cleaning, there is a lovely, giant, upside brush which you place into a sink.

As a native of New Orleans, I highly recommend Acme to anyone, tourist or local. You will find both sorts of guest eating there on any given day.\n\nAcme is know for their charbroiled oysters. After you've sampled them plain, try them with the green Tabasco sauce, or another green, jalapeno-based hot sauce. If you don't like oysters at all, Acme has much other New Orleans cuisine to offer. Of course they serve good gumbo and excellent poor boys.\n\nIn my mind, Acme will always be paired with Drago's restaurant, and I certainly recommend Drago's as well. In fact, Drago's retains a certain mystique that Acme is at least perceived to lack. For many years, Drago's had only a single location. It was located in a near suburb of New Orleans, and thus had to subsist almost entirely on local business. As a result, Drago's is more of a part of local New Orleans culture than is Acme.\n\nAcme, from its beginning, had a sort of financial head start on Drago's, due to its downtown location. Acme has not sat on its laurels, though. Rather, it has kept pace with Drago's as menus have been honed and expectations raised. I do not hesitate to rate Acme \"5 star.\"","date":1456284867000}

I'm not sure what the hype is all about for this place, but it was by far the most crowded oyster house in the French Quarters of New Orleans. The line was already long on a Thursday evening, so we thought... Hmm, let's come Friday! But, the line was even longer on Friday... And through the whole weekend. So Monday it was... A minimal wait for about fifteen minutes.\n\nSeriously? The best dish we probably had was the half dozen raw oysters. I was already all \"oystered\" out from eating raw oyster five days in a row! But these oysters were really fresh and served with lemon, red cocktail sauce, and more hot sauce. Very delicious slurping in the raw bottom ocean feeders. Very enjoyable... Beer or an alcoholic beverage is a must! Ha!\n\nThe corn and crab chowder was okay. I think I've tried better elsewhere in Northern California. A bit on the bland side... Maybe because my mouth was already burning from the hot sauce eating the oysters? Well, it was another friend's order... So I was merely trying it out... Or at least ate half of hers. Lol.\n\nI had the Poopa Bowl. It's a seafood gumbo served in a breaded bowl. It was tasty, and I really liked the southern flavor with a spicy kick! The bread bowl was a good size. But the proportions inside was small. What made it worse was they added too much rice inside and not enough seafood and gravy for the gumbo. The bread bowl itself already soaked up most of the gravy. I still liked it though.\n\nI also tried my friend's New Orleans Medley. It's basically a combination of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice and grilled smoked sausage. I probably liked the sausage the best, and then the gumbo and the jambalaya. Didn't really care about the filler rice and beans. I wish the proportions was bigger.\n\nLastly, we also had the Boom Boom Shrimp, and the Shrimp Po Boy. Seriously, I was a bit disappointed on these two orders. The Boom Boom Shrimp was nothing but fried shrimp with dipping sauce that tastes like sweet and sour shrimp. They give you lemon slices to use just to give it more flavor. Bleh, very sub par. No big deal.  And the Shrimp Po Boy was horrible. Probably the worst I ever had. The French Bread was already dry, and the shrimps was even more dry. It's the same style shrimps used for the Boom Boom Shrimp order, but minus the sauce. Very disappointed because it was dry with a little sauce and cabbage, which made it hard to swallow.\n\nThe mixed drinks were decent. We had Tito's Vodka and Cranberry on the rocks, and a Pear Mojito. The drinks were not not strong, but the Pear Mojito was a bit too sweet for me. It needed more mint leaves and another shot of Vodka. Lol.\n\nOverall, this place was just okay. It's definitely all hype. Don't let the lines deceive you. There are plenty of other places that serves the same stuff all over the French Quarters. A bit too hectic for me. But a great experience though. The service was decent regardless on how busy they get. I honestly think it's a below average 3 stars place. Not worth the wait though.","date":1485939472000}

I think it's good to have a mix of the two types of oysters because one of fresh and the other is salty\/buttery; it's a good balance. \n\nThe place wasn't too pricey, but I had wished we had gotten more oysters inside of filler food because those were worth it. I could probably eat like a dozen if I wanted to.","date":1498311177000}

Luckily, I had just come from an early lunch, so it worked out for me to simply order boo fries (roast beef, cheddar and gravy topped fries).\n\nWhile the reviews are mostly gung-ho about these fries, I really thought they were just okay. You have to eat them pretty quickly or they become cold and soggy. The meat on them was good, but I don't think I'd order the fries again.\n\nThe actual restaurant operation and organization was a turn-off to me. First, you can wait a long time while they find a perfectly sized table for your party. Make sure every member of your group is waiting with you or they won't seat you when that perfectly sized table opens. Group of ten behind you? Watch as they get seated way before you. Oh, and you're waiting in a line outside. Tough luck if it's cold and raining that day.\n\nBetween the long wait, the lack of meal options for non-seafood folk, and the low-rise table that looked like it was better suited for children, it's unlikely that I'd personally return.

Acme Oyster has some throwback charm with the basic tables and quirky signs.  \n\nWe knew right away that we wanted to order a dozen oysters on the half shell and an order of the chargrilled oysters, which came with 6.  The raw oysters were delish! I like my raw oysters on the small to medium size and these were perfect, with just the right amount of ocean taste.  The chargrilled oysters - a New Orleans and Acme classic - were amazing.  I didn't know what to expect as I rarely eat my oysters cooked, except for the occasional dish, but the oysters used were the same size as the raw oysters and they were grilled in a delicious butter and parmesan cheese concoction.  The oysters developed a soft crust of parmesan which when eaten with the french bread provided - DY-NO-MITE! We should have ordered more...\n\nFor lunch entrees, I got the soft shell crab platter and the BF got the Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy, which is their famous po-boy with half fried shrimp and half fried oysters with tabasco mayo.  My soft shell crab was humongous! I didn't know you could get soft shells that big - it was equivalent to a large size crab.  The legs were crispy and meaty and the body was cooked perfectly where I can still taste the juicy-ness of it.

Don't feel discouraged though - the line moves because people don't stay long.

If you like oysters, you'll like the oysters here.  Nothing special though, but to be honest, I'm not a big oyster fan.

Not a fan of oysters, but man this was really good.  And you knew it was bad by the amount of yellow oil or butter or whatever was dripping out of those shells.  They had bread which I dipped into that stuff and it made it taste so good (it was probably butter FYI).  The chargrilled oysters were absolutely the best dish that I had in NOLA.\n\nAfter that, everything else was just OK.  The fried crab claws were good until about the fourth one.  That's when the amount of fried stuff that I was eating was making me feel a little queasy.  The single crab platter - I didn't have a bite of it, but apparently it was pretty good.  The peacemaker po' boy sandwich was solid.  But honestly, with all the fried stuff, it's kind of hard not to like it.  I probably wouldn't order any of them when I return here.

The butter and the Parmesan cheese worked cohesively with the savoriness of the garlic which lifted the taste of the oyster.

This is not a 4 star restaurant in NOLA, but it is a 4 star Oyster House in my opinion, or at the least, a 4 star Po Boy.  Call it 3.5 if you want, but I am rounding it up.\n\nA negative about this place, as you'll read in many other reviews, is the lack of reservations and space, so you literally stand on line outside.  But don't fret, this is common (oyster house across the street does the same thing).  The line moves pretty quickly, though a lot of large parties come, which tends to slow up the works.  Anyway, there were maybe 8-10 tables in front of us, including a party of 10 or more, but we were seated within 30 minutes.\n\nDuring that time, we got some kind of blueberry martini (you can't bring in outside drinks, but you can get drinks at the bar while waiting and bring them back outside to the line - you gotta love NOLA).  Those were delicious.  Highly recommended.\n\nI'm not an oyster eater - my girlfriend is - but the purpose of this visit was to get a good po-boy.  She got a 1\/2 shrimp 1\/2 oyster and loved it.  I got a roast beef po boy.  Essentially, a roast beef sandwich made to look like a po boy.  Kind of made me wonder what makes a po boy a po boy.  Give me some au jus, and this would have been the perfect french dip sandwich.  Regardless, I don't care if this wasn't a po boy in the classic sense - this was an awesome sandwich.  Enjoyed every bite.\n\nThe inside is a bit crowded and loud, but its NOLA, so that's what you get.  We were sitting at the oyster bar, so not the most comfortable location, but the inside is lively and pleasant and you can definitely have a good time here and a good meal.

Although the storefront is fairly narrow, two dining rooms inside offer a cavernous dining environment; unembellished and ordinary.  People don't come here for the fancy trappings, and trust me on this, people DO come here in droves.  Expect a wait for a table; the line is often long, but moves quickly.  Once seated, the parade of local dishes begins: chowders, gumbos and similar stewed offerings, raw and cocktail shellfish and boiled, broiled and fried fin and shell fish.  The half-shell oysters were fresh and flavorful, although not without a few shell fragments.  Fried crustaceans, in the local 'po boy mode, are prepared a bit differently in this area.  Where much of the world prefers a thin and crisp batter coating over moist protein, the preference is for a more substantial batter cooked to a golden brown with a solid nugget of fish inside.  From Alexandria, through Baton Rouge, and down to the Crescent City, this is 'po boy fried fish.  Acme Oyster House is a fun place where beer and hurricanes flow freely, and a good choice for dining as well.","date":1324272299000}

Luckily we came before the huge line formed outside, so we were immedietely seated at the bar. \n\nI'm a giant fan of oysters, being from the Pacific Northwest and now a New York City transplant, so I had to try them. Surprisingly they don't have varieties to choose from... They are just \"oysters\"...What kind, i have no idea....Anyway, my friend and I order a dozen raw oysters. They were well shucked and served quickly. There was plenty of lemon and a delicious cocktail sauce offered. Tabasco available on every table. I'm a bit of a purist so I just take a drop of lemon and a pinch of cocktail sauce. \n\nI have to admit that the oysters were huge and very filling. They were not the best but not the worse I've had...They were salty but not very briney (which I prefer). Still, among the large\/huge sized oysters I've tried, these are the best. If you favorite oyster is kumamoto or a kushi, then you probably won't like these... \n\nNext time I'm going to try the chargrilled oysters...Not sure what that means but I love to try new things!","date":1288986356000}

It was by far the best seat of the house as we got to watch the oysters getting shucked.  Plus there was a big mirror behind the bar and we were able to people watch.  Being somewhat timid about the raw oysters, I made the choice to get chargrilled instead.  It took about 15 minutes for them to show up, but it was well worth the wait.  Absolutely delicious!!  The oysters were very fresh.  They were so good, I got another half order!  I also ordered the seafood gumbo which was eh.  Not a great deal of seafood or spices.

But we weren't there for just the oysters so, decided to stick it out. The line moved really quick! We waited about 15-20 mins. Got to the second from the front of the line, lady saw we had an infant, told us to come on in. We were seated in the back area, which was packed full of happy people having a great time. We were promptly attended to by our server Keicia and a gentleman assisting us in stowing away the baby stroller. We knew what we wanted so we ordered the food and drinks at the same time. We ordered a hurricane and a beer. The beer was nice and cold and the hurricane was great of course. \nFood, glorious food!!! Red beans and rice, gumbo, jambalaya, fried soft shell crab, fried crab claws and chargrilled oysters. Everything was delicious. But the stars of the show were the oysters. Omg. I could eat those everyday. They were grilled to perfection and were very flavorful. We decided to end our feast with dessert and Keicia talked us into the pecan cobbler with ice cream. It was my daughters bday and we didn't have a candle so Keicia lit her lighter while she sang happy bday to her. She was so attentive and amazing. \nEverything was so perfect. \nLet me talk about the service some more. This place was insanely busy and EVERY single person working was happy and smiling. We also had attention from nearly all of the staff in the back room because we had a very cute 8 month old with us. By attention I mean, they all talked to her, sang to her and doted on her. One waitress even joking scolded some guys for being too loud while rooting for their basketball team that was playing on the tv. Let me tell you, this is not a place to go for a quiet dinner. Lol.

Our group size was nine, and so they would not seat us until our whole group was together.  This is important to know since Bourbon Street does have some.... distractions.  Once we finally had our whole group together it was another 30 minutes as we waited to be seated, and this was a Wednesday in the middle of summer.  I can't imagine the wait during prime time.\n\nSecond, the food is good, but it is mostly fried.  If you are not into fried food, you may not want to go here.  I hadn't had a Po'Boy yet, and so I let the waiter choose one for me, and he chose the 'soft shelled crab'.  This was my first soft shelled crab and it arrived fried in a batter on the Po'Boy bun with all the fixins.  I liked it.\n\nThird, it is air conditioned, and in July this is truly a blessing.  It was 98 outside and about 90% humidity.  It was a great relief to get inside.\n\nFourth, they do sell beer by the pitcher.  They had three on tap the night we were there, and we went with the Abita Amber.  It was good, cold, and short lived.\n\nFifth, they've got some signs that pay homage to those that have eaten 15 dozen oysters, and one guy who ate 51 dozen.  As I thought about this, I was struggled to imagine how this would go.  Do you start ordering them and then get into a rhythm and just continue?  What happens if you have seven and stop?  Can you take a break at about the 12th dozen?  Is there a time limit?  Is there a Monty Python film in the foreseeable future?\n\nGood food, good location, get your group together and enjoy.

This is a high volume place, and the speed and noise level of the restaurant is a part of the experience. I'm a big oyster fan, but am more accustomed to the Toronto-mode of the  $3 oyster with a regional designation. I was a bit surprised to see the oysters arriving uncleaned, with dirt and smaller sea-creatures still clinging to them, but I was not disappointed by their quality for the price. The oysters were all quite large and well-shucked, and the chargrilled oysters were delicious and very indulgent.

We got in line, and right away saw that they move it pretty quickly. We waited for about 30 minutes, maybe less. That's about the average for any restaurant on a Friday or Saturday, which for us, it was a Saturday. We ended up sitting at the bar, since it was just my wife and I. Our server, was Charlie. We got to see them shucking the oysters and prepping them for the different ways they serve them. It's awesome. Charlie gave us his recommendations and we tried the jambalaya and the soft shell crab, along with the Chargrilled Oysters. Man!! Everything was amazingly good. We sat next to a couple who was also visiting from Los Angeles, so it was cool to experience this restaurant with some of our own peeps.

It's a very loud restaurant with a lot of commotion; the line is usually pretty long.  On my last visit to New Orleans, we had eaten there for the first time and it was okay.  On this visit, we came with friends because it seemed like the thing to do for the picky eater we had in our crowd.\n\nThe food is okay, it's all just fried fare, and the Red Beans and Rice were all right not a whole lot of flavor going on though.  I have never been a fan of oysters and don't really see the allure of allowing a slimy nub to float down the back of my throat but if you are into that, I hear this is the place to go.  I will say that the char-grilled oysters are amazing, oysters covered in butter and Parmesan grilled too a perfection with several slabs of french bread to sop up the butter and cheese, that is how I enjoy an oyster.

It looks and smells like any old oyster bar, maybe a bit dirtier but you can't quite tell because it's all masked in red light!\n\nWe were finally seated and the first raw oyster I slurped up had to be the most balanced, succulent, disappears in your mouth- good, most delicious oyster yet!!! I was hooked! \n\nWe came to New Orleans from Seattle specifically for food and even though I had a list of about 25 restaurants I wanted to dine at we found ourselves here 3 times during our 5 day trip (also conveniently located right across the street from us - we stayed at hotel Mazarin)\n\nThe raw oysters seriously have to be the best I've had! Or maybe just the most unique ones I've had? Either way, I ate about 2 dozen in total and each of them were so fresh and so light! None left a murky dirty after taste or were gritty or tasted too much like the sea.. I hate when that happens.\n\nThe chargrilled oysters were obviously crack.. Butter and cheese on top these already perfect oysters?! Straight heaven in your mouth! None were over cooked or too chewy. And the French bread was perfect to pick up the leftover sauce er butter.\n\nAnnnnd surprisingly, their gumbo was the best gumbo we had in New Orleans!  Corn and crab chowder was delicious too!\n\nThe people at the oyster bar were a pleasure to chat with! AND they have chipotle Tabasco!!!! Such a win all around.\n\nMy only complaint is..

Inside we were met with a typical casual style seafood house.  The staff was friendly and attentive and the char-grilled oysters were plump and tasty with a slight spice in their buttery sauce.\n\nWe were off to a great start! Unfortunately, the good times did NOT roll on. Considering the delicious char grilled oysters, I decided to try an oyster and fish combination platter. The fish was very thin like a tilapia but it was tasty. The French fries were nondescript. The coleslaw was very good with a rough chop and a mayo dressing that did not over power the crunchiness of the slaw. The problem? THE OYSTERS! Were they really oysters? What happened to the plump beauties we were served char-grilled. The fried oysters were hard little bits of batter with no oyster to be seen or tasted. When it was mentioned to our server that they must be overcooked she immediately set off to bring me a fresh helping. Unfortunately it was just more of the same. So, the conclusion is that this oyster house does not know how to cook oysters!\n\nMy husband's shrimp po'boy was also a disappointment with small so so shrimp and a chewy roll with little flavor.\n\nOn our way to New Orleans we had the good fortune to stop at a Wentzell's Oyster House and they fried the perfect whole, juicy oyster.

The seating process is very serious.\nOnce we got in, I ordered a prickly pear martini, a dozen chargrilled oysters (to split), and the large etouffe. The etouffe arrived before anything (even the cocktail, which took unusually long). I've had etouffe about 5 times in different cities in Louisiana and this was the worst. It was pretty bland in respect to etouffe (The first time I have ever added Tabasco sauce to etouffe). There were no crawfish-just those small, cheap shrimp. I saw there was an option to add fried crawfish tails for $3-4 extra, but I didn't think that meant the dish came with 0 crawfish. I've never seen etouffe with just the cheap tiny shrimp before. My cocktail (prickly pair margarita) was gross. It tasted like cough medicine and I could barley finish it. The chargrilled oysters were the sort-of savior. Having had really good, high quality oysters in other cities...I didn't think the oysters themselves were the best I've had, but the sauce they were in was delicious. One of the oysters was burned to a crisp and probably shouldn't have been served. I'd rate the oysters alone a 4. I also tasted my friends gumbo and thought it was ok.\nI think the good reviews come from tourists that have never had good Cajun food. I'm from NY and far from an expert, but the quality just wasn't here. I definitely would not recommend coming here and waiting in line when there are so many good places in New Orleans.

This dish was just ok for me.\n\nFinally the Crawfish Boil special arrived and did not disappoint. These bugs were big and delicious. Nice amounts of seasoning were used for the boil as you get a good shot of that boil with each suck of the Crawfish head. Not too spicy.\n\nNoise level was a 9 out of 10 but I found this to be the norm on any restaurant near or on Bourbon Street.\n\n4 stars","date":1553225324000}

We had just come over from the French Quarter, not an hour after an order of beignets apiece, complete with cafe au laits. Once we arrived, we had a 40-minute wait in line outside the restaurant in near-100% humidity, which was not at all comfortable. That said, we got inside before the inevitable storm hit because there were only 2 of us, so we were able to snag a seat at the bar. \n\nThe staff person assisting us was incredibly friendly and brought out my cup of gumbo and half-shrimp po'boy and the boyfriend's full-size chipped beef po'boy in record time. The boyfriend's response to his first bite of the chipped beef was \"Are you kidding me?!\" Which, translated, means he thought it was amazing, and I'd have to agree. The food was great and well-portioned. Neither of us are oyster fans, so I can't speak to that part of the restaurant's eponymous shellfish platters.\n\nWe could have lingered after our meal over drinks and good conversation with the folks next to us at the bar, we didn't think it was fair to keep the other pairs in line longer than they needed. And while we got absolutely soaked as we left, it added to the whole NOLA \"feel\" of our visit, making for a perfect final night. If I find myself in New Orleans again, I'll definitely make it back - just maybe with a little more room in my stomach.","date":1479111968000}

This year we got there around 5pm on Sunday to beat the dinner crowd which can sometimes have you standing in line for hours waiting for a table. Luckily we only had to wait about 15 mins before getting seated. The inside of Acme is super casual, with a mix of individual tables and communal seating at large picnic tables with classic checkered table clothes. The lighting is dim and the vibe is lively with people ready to dig into some seafood.\n\nWe got the chargrilled oysters to start, of course. This is a dish that everyone will love, even if they claim they don't like oysters, as did some of the people we were dining with. These are buttery and covered in parmesan and so delicious. And soaking up the oil\/sauce in the bottom of the dish with the bread slices is just as good as the oysters themselves - this is why we come to Acme! For the main, we got some boiled crawfish and a seafood platter with fried shrimp, fried oysters, and crabcake to share. The crawfish were the biggest ones I had while in new orleans, super meaty tails that were easy to peel out of the shell, I could eat these all day. \n\nFried seafood is pretty much all you'll find on this menu outside of the oysters and some apps but its delicious. The fried oysters were so tender and the shrimp was nice and meaty and paired really well with the arrangement of sauces they bring.

Well, it is,because that's what the staff told me. The food is kinda expensive, but I do appreciate that they offer a new Orleans sampler, with rice and beans, sausage, your choice of chicken and sausage or seafood gumbo (the chicken and sausage is more flavorful) and jambalaya. \n\nThe gumbo was served with a bit of rice in the inside and boy was it a flavor bomb. It is absolutely filled with sausage and chicken in every bite, the broth is salty and salty and spicy,almost like a beef stew on steroids.  It's hard for me to judge because new orleans cuisine is definitely one I am not familiar with. I can say that it is delicious though,and that I'm happy that they offered a sampler platter. The chicken was tender, and not overcooked like it often is in chicken soup, and the sausage was full of meety flavor, adding its distinct saltiness to the jumbo. \n\nWhoa, the Jambaya is salty. Like super salty. It has chopped chicken (which had toughened up into something resembling chunks of pork) and sausage (chopped into small pieces)  in it. And both are flavored strongly enough to stand out from the rice of the jumbo (which is what is super salty).\n\nThe beans and rice  are pretty good. Not the best baked beans Ive ever had. Theyre almost like slow cooked red beans in Mexican cooking. Except these are a bit softer, and are simmer with chopped up pork. A nice diversion from the salt heavy dishes. \nThe sausage is actually my favorite. Its not super salty, sliced long side and grilled, giving it a nice char. It was meaty, not super salty, almost peppery. Definitely different from any sausage I've had before. Drier, but made up for it with the char, which I liked. \n\nThe chargrilled oysters smelled delicious, but for $11.50 for half a dozen, Im going to go and see if I can find a place cheaper before I come back and splurge. Also, the only ingredients on the chargrilled oysters are according to the man at the bar: garlic butter and romano cheese\n\nThis is how you shuck an oyster. Stuck the knife into the hole where the tendon holding the shell is. Pressure that hole until it pops, then cut both the muscles (one on each side) holding the oyster in place. And its so much harder than it looks. \n\n In the end, the food here is average. But your not really coming here for the food are you? your coming here to for the atmosphere, to watch the people at the bar shuck oysters. Thats the main attraction here","date":1282761011000}

I'd tried Desire (another fun oyster place) on a previous, and thought it was decent-good, so I thought we would visit it. Desire was closed, so I suggested we try the nearby Acme Oyster House. I hadn't been there in at least five years, and I thought we'd give it a go. Normally it has terrible lines, but it was bare on Tuesday for lunch, so it seemed to be an opportune moment to check it out.\n\nI feel really bad for anybody coming to New Orleans who comes here for a raw oyster and shows up here to find out what all the fuss is about. \n\nThe oysters I was served at Acme were some of the blandest and least flavorful oysters I've had in recent memory. They came perfectly plated (perhaps *too* perfectly plated?), and seem to have been stored and chilled somewhere in bulk. I looked and looked for any sort of flavor, and the only time these oysters stopped being dull was when one of my girlfriend's ended up tasting like mud, silt, and something that comes out of a body part best left unmentioned on a family review site. \n\nIt's like this: a good gulf oyster ought to have some sort of taste. Some salt, a little tang, *something*. These were just lumps of flavorless flesh, suitable only for tasting the cocktail sauce they were served with. They were so bland, my girlfriend and I agreed we should go next door to the Bourbon House, and try for a do-over when it came to looking for an oyster.\n\nFWIW, here's what I liked about the place:\n\n- Expected local beers (Abita variants, etc.) all on tap\n- Staff seemed nice and friendly\n- We didn't get sick from the oysters?\n\nIf you want to understand why I gave this place one star, read the above review, and then realize this place normally has people *standing in a line outside the door* to get in.

We tried coming in on a sunday night, but the line was so long we decided to go another day. We successfully came in here for lunch on monday around noon. The place was still busy, but there was no line and open tables in the back. We were greeted by a woman who seemed \"thrilled\" to be working. She seemed irritated, never smiled or welcomed us, and was unpleasant to the people who came in to get seated after us.\n\nWe ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters with a side of jambalaya and red beans and rice. For some weird reason, our sides come out first. Not sure if that was a mistake, or if that's just how they do things around there? Regardless, both side dishes were amazing. The jambalaya was perfectly seasoned. It had a bit of heat to it but it was just right. The red beans and rice were very hearty, quite thick, and had a milder flavor. \n\nWhen the oysters arrived, I was quite surprised by the lovely presentation. They were big, fresh, steamy, and had cheese and oil on top. The oysters also came with 5-6 slices of bread to soak the richness from the oyster shells. The oysters were delicious, flavorful, and very filling. I was worried that we didn't order enough food, but it was definitely enough for two people. I had lunch with a bloody mary and it was very tasty and well seasoned. Our waitress was nice too. \n\n\\","date":1342461954000}

Your entire party has to be present upon seating or else they won't let your group in at all. My group almost got kicked out because half of our party of 4 was wandering the next street over looking for beignets.\n\nBoo Fries ($4.99) - a plate of thick cut fries smothered in gravy, roast beef, and melty cheese. It's a pretty small plate for the price, but the gravy is really delicious. Did not detect any actual roast beef on it though.\n\nOyster Shooter ($2.99) - your typical oyster shooter with vodka and cocktail sauce. Make sure you mix the vodka and cocktail sauce together before you shoot it!\n\n12 Chargrilled Oysters ($19.99) -the large ones are juicy and have oyster soup leftover in the shell to sop up with the white bread they serve you with. The small ones aren't really worth it but I guess you can't choose the size when ordering a full dozen.\n\n12 Raw Oysters ($15.49) - typical large juicy oysters served with a side of cocktail sauce. Good! But I didn't think it was especially amazing or anything compared to raw oysters in L.A.\n\nService is slow because they're super busy, and the mood itself isn't really my style. It's dark and flashing neon lights everywhere give it a dirty bar-style feel which I think is just the theme of Bourbon Street.

We even came at 5:45 and the line was already 45 min long.  When we came and actually got inside, we came in around 2:35PM...it's a good idea to call ahead and ask if there's a wait.  They don't take reservations.

No disrespect to Felixes, which was very good, but ACME was definitely that much better when we finally got our chance.   Had a half dozen of the grilled oysters and a half of the raw, plus some fries.  Looking back, probably shouldve just ordered more oysters instead of wasting the space the fries took in my stomach, cuz the them oysters were just that deelish.\n\nTheir grilled oysters were seasoned and, for lack of a better word, \"sauced,\" perfectly, we didn't even need to add any lemon to it at all.

My celiac-self was so thrilled to indulge in a couple classic NOLA dishes -- you know it's rough when so much of the cuisine out here is fried and\/or begins with a delicious gluten-filled roux (I WANT TO EAT IT), so having even a few options on the menu is pretty rad. They make it clear on their menu that they don't have a separate cooking space for anything gluten-free, but I personally feel totally fine and really loved my meal.\n\nThis place was busy on a Sunday afternoon. There is zero waiting space inside, so poke your head in the door to let the hostess know you'd like a table, then you gotta wait outside. Being a party of one, I only had to wait like 4 minutes. I was seated by the window so I could watch people walk up and down Iberville Street. Always a fan of people-watching. I loved Acme's black and white checkered table cloths, all the neon red lights, and the overall energy. My hostess and waitress were both super sweet and checked on me often, calling me \"baby\" and \"sweetie\" and \"hon\" (as they call everyone). \n\nThey were out of chargrilled oysters during my visit (damn), but the 1\/2 dozen oysters on the half shell with lemon and spicy cockail sauce were stellar. Like reaallllly really good. I love a good oyster but am picky with them -- I get easily turned off if they're too gooey, filled with too much liquid, or smell\/taste too fishy. These were just right and I probably could have had a dozen alone. I also ordered a side of red beans and rice and a side of jambalaya. Salty with a nice heat, I enjoyed them both. But I totally loved the red beans & rice the most and even ordered a second side of them. Next time I'll get the plate with smoked sausage cause I wanted more more more. \n\nAlso ordered a glass of cabernet for $10, and my experience was about $35 overall (not including tip, but I definitely tipped well)!

It moved very quick, however, and soon we were seated at a long table in the back next to a party of four girls who were essentially the Wal-Mart version of \"Sex and the City.\"  (\"Carrie\" asked me a bunch of questions about my admittedly neon-tinged specialty drink--don't judge; it was the last night of my vacation and I had drunk all the bourbon I could--and then she delivered a bunch of really loud, really bogus advice about men to her gal pals for the duration of our meal).\n\nWell-meaning but obnoxious company aside, the food was pretty good.  Not amazing, but solid, and our waitress was attentive and fielded questions about gluten-free options for one member of our party like a pro (no small feat in a joint where everything good is dipped in flour and fried like a mo-fo).  \n\nIn short, if your goal in New Orleans is artery blockage, a quick bite, or that second heart attack, grab a table here.

The longest that we had to wait was for about 10min for a party of 4 and they even offered us a beer for waiting in the line out side. So after the waiter called us we were seated in the back area and walking thru this place everyone greeted you ( thanks for coming ). We ordered half a dozen oysters on a half shell and haft baked you have to if you're going to an oyster house (lol). I love my oysters gritty and they smelled & tasted so fresh my husband even found a pearl in one of the raw ones. After we ordered the two soft shell crabs. I had not tried soft shell crabs in the past, but if that's what they taste like I want the all the time.. Excellent ..","date":1466013776000}

The oysters had just the right amount of crunch, on the outside, but were warm and soft on the inside.  The breading had it's own unique flavor.  What was so good was the breading had flavor.  The whole poboy had flavor.  Other places, it's just a breaded oyster between two slices of bread.....not here, not even close.  This thing tasted amazing.  \n\nWe just went back a month ago again.

We were told it'd be a 20 minute wait, we waited for 40 minutes.  Was it worth it?  HECK YES!  If the wait were longer it probably wouldn't have been and I would've just been a hungry\/grumpy hippo.\n\nHere's what we had:\n\n- Raw oysters: They're HUGE and meaty!  Totally worth the price!  I've never seen oysters as big as these, but it makes me wonder if other places here have the same size too? \n- Char-grilled oysters (aka rockefeller oysters): yum yum in my tum!  I can barely eat oysters (i always stick to the small ones because they're sweeter) but I was able to chow down 2 of these easily!\n- Seafood gumbo: It's topped with a little bit of white rice and cheese.. SUPER good and probably one of the better ones I've had. \n- Crawfish tails: Deep fried pieces placed on top of two pieces of bread.  It's a good appetizer portion, but was perfect for me since I dipped some into my gumbo, and had oysters on the side as well.  \n\nThey also have a couple deep fried plates to choose from as well, but you can honestly get those anywhere else (as well as the po-boys) so I'd recommend trying their oysters, if not raw then the char-grilled ones for sure!","date":1335890832000}

Line out the door, easily 8-10 people deep waiting OUTSIDE, and the street we were on smelled like trash water. They got through everyone fairly quickly, but when we got inside we realized how much of a chain (or at least it looked like a chain) this was. We were seated at the bar... not exactly ideal, but we were hungry, so whatever.\n\nThe bartender was friendly enough and took our orders -- my sister-in-law got the seafood gumbo, I got the jambalaya and an order of hushpuppies. Our food came out in MAYBE 3 minutes... honestly not the best sign when we're looking for \"made to order\" food. My sister-in-law took two bites of her gumbo before declaring that it tasted like beef stew. My hushpuppies were barely warm, and my jambalaya was unevenly heated... HOT on one side, COLD in the middle, and warm-ish on the right. What the hell? Not only that, but both tasted like crap. Cheap, unimpressive, tasteless.\n\nIt took us AT LEAST 5 solid minutes to get the bartender's attention. She had walked over RIGHT as our food was served and asked if we were okay, and we said yes. It seemed like she wasn't interested in chatting with us again for a while. She walked right by us several times as we sat with our hands folded and didn't even glance over. We finally did grab her (by yelling for her) and told her we were unsatisfied. She seemed confused and called over the manager (I didn't catch his name -- big guy, brown hair). \n\nWe would have been open to giving Acme another chance if the manager hadn't been such a douchebag to us. The bartender wasn't so great either. The second he walked over she yelled out \"I asked them if they were okay and they said yes!\" and quickly clarified to us that she didn't want to be blamed. Well, no shit, who blames the server for the food quality?\n\nWe told him that our food was cold and unappetizing, and he seemed to be in a state of disbelief. He asked us if we would like to order anything else off the menu (no mention of this being on the house), and we declined, saying we'd rather just leave. He then asked, in a rude tone, if we just wanted our food heated up. I'd had enough at this point and told him \"heating it up won't make it taste any better\". He then let out a big sigh and said \"OKAY then, if that's what you want\" and just walked off. NO apology whatsoever... he huffed off like an upset 5-year-old and left us sitting there confused.

The po boys tasted like any other po boy that is out there, the jambalaya really wasn't what was expected, especially since a friend that's from Louisiana said that it wasn't a true jambalaya, but the oysters is definitely the best bang for your buck! Should've just stuck with oysters for the experience. Overall, this place is fun and lively, but it's not the worth the wait in line. Try other places that isn't so populated because the food can be just as good or ever better.","date":1446152192000}

What a place, same crew with me as with our visit to Verona.  Tonight we dined in \"family fashion\" and yes it was enough!  Tonights feast consisted of a cold pitcher of beer, chilled raw oysters, the chargrilled oysters, the New Orleans Medley, Fried Soft Shell Crab Platter, and the New Orleans Bread Pudding.  This little Oyster joint has a lot to offer everyone (except for kids) the restaurant is air conditioned nicely and the ambience is very lively, much like its city surroundings.  The employees are very in tune with the draw and the need to feel the aim to please.  As you walk in, the shucking  team is busy at work opening the delightful little morsels of pleasure and sets the tone for the high flow of foot traffic that consist of the patrons and the servers.  The music is loud and hair pulling, enough of a mix to keep any generation tapping their toes and their forks as they indulge in brew of their choice.  \n\nAs for our selection, it left everyone at the table satisfied and ready for more; so much so, that we, in fact did order more oysters.   These little buggers were so fresh and tasty that two of the three of us (really they were fearing the idea of eating them) fell in love with the half heart melters.  On ice or grilled the Oysters are a MUST for any vistor.......IF YOU THINK OR EVEN KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE OYSTERS, I DON'T CARE, YOU MUST TRY ACME OYSTERS.   The Gumbo was so inviting and  smooth that it made me feel guilty that I didn't just order a bowl to my own.  The soft crab was prepared to melt in your mouth and it did!  We all devoured the two naked crustaceans with a verve of starvation.  Finally the New Orleans Bread Pudding was a shameful bowl of pleasure, with every spoonful you curse yourself for eating so much during the main coarse, that you wish you could have another bowl.  The beauty of the portion is the foresight of the maker to portion it in a small bowl in order to entice you to come and come again!   \n\nYes, we are tourist of the first degree and yes, we are foodies as well, but one thing I can tell you is I know flavor and also the fact that my wife and daughter were able to walk away feeling sated, especially after eating (the feared) oysters, proves that Acme definitely knows what they are doing.","date":1405476082000}

Win!\n\nSince we were starving from walking around on our cemetery tour, we also ordered the boo fries (fries covered in roast beef gravy and cheese) - really tasty. Exactly the sort of artery-clogging dish we wanted at the time. \n\nAs for an entree, we wanted to try a little bit of everything, so our waitress suggested some sort of fried fish sampler platter. It had crawfish, white fish, and fried shrimp. I wasn't thrilled with this. I have had better. I just think it was a little too doughy...I can't even really put my finger on it.

We got in line around 7:30 and waited less than ten minutes to be seated at the bar. However, the wait was made pretty unpleasant by the rotten seafood smell coming from the alley. The hostess was very friendly and took us to two seats right in front of the oyster bar. \n\nOur \"server\" was one of the guys shucking oysters in the sink right in front of us. He was very friendly and, since he was stationed right in front of us at all times, very prompt. Started off with half a dozen chargrilled oysters and some adult beverages, waited another 8-10 minutes, and then ordered a peacemaker po boy and a chicken and sausage jumbalaya. The entrees came before the oysters (which was a little disappointing) but the oysters were close behind. My wife really enjoyed her jumbalaya, but the po boy was pretty sorry. The oysters on the po boy were nice, but the shrimp were basically salad shrimp (probably 60-80 count) and pretty pathetic given the other po boy options in the city. The highlight for me was definitely the chargrilled oysters. This is the first time I have had oysters cooked over a fire, and it did not disappoint. The grill gives a really nice hint of smoke, and the garlic butter and Parmesan on top add a nice flavor. I wish I would've skipped the po boy and just ordered a dozen more oysters. \n\nOverall, it was a very good experience and definitely made me a chargrilled oyster fan. However, I have to knock them for the pathetic excuse for shrimp on the po boy.","date":1493826425000}

You need to try this at least once! It's addictive! Maybe it's the vodka!\n\nChargrilled Oysters - Ok. The raw oysters are a must, but you should try these, the light char on the oyster and that butter sauce is OMG!! \n\nRoast Beef Po Boy - This is totally a New Orleans' thing, but you have to do this.  It's the same roast beef gravy as the Boo Fries except more of it and it dressed.  The combination of the bread, roast beef, and gravy is so delectable! \n\nFried Oyster Po Boy - So if you're going to do a seafood Po Boy, you can't go wrong with the oyster Po Boy. The taste of the fresh oysters and there's oysters in every bite. The damn things keep falling off the sandwich, and it is so amazing.

Absolutely, but it's pretty solid. The location in the French Quarter almost always has a line down the block, but the line usually moves quickly.\n\nAcme was our first stop when we arrived in New Orleans Friday afternoon. We had a party of five and didn't wait in line long at all. They're known for their oysters, so I started off with a 1\/2 dozen chargrilled ones. They were plump and delicious! When they arrived to the table, they were sizzling hot. For my entree, I decided on the 1\/2 shrimp po boy and a cup of crab & corn bisque. Everything tasted great. The po boy was filled with tiny shrimp and the bisque was excellent. Our waitress was very welcoming and accommodated us very well given how busy they were.","date":1500842893000}

The ambiance is a dive place but things are clean and we like the casual environment. The food rocks!!!! I can't say enough about this place! We always get the raw oysters, root beer on tap, the PeaceMaker po-boy and the gumbo. I live in Texas and the gumbo there is usually this gross tomato like sauce. The roux in the gumbo at Acme is different- it's brown tasty deliciousness! Soooooooo good! If we stay in NOLA a few days, we always eat at Acme for almost half our meals-especially lunches. The bread on the po-boys is delicious and you can add lots of their various sauces to the po-boy to make it sloppy which makes it even better. The cocktail sauce that comes with the raw oysters is one of our favorite things on earth. It tastes so fresh and has the perfect amount of horseradish sauce to it. The prices are good, $13 I think for a dozen of oysters. We usually end up not spending too much because portions are large and we share dishes. There are intimidating lines outside but they move fast (at least the lunch ones do). This place is a NOLA institution and a tourist trap but despite the high traffic of customers, the wait staff always makes us feel special and each of the waiters have their own unique New Orleans personailities. If you ever received not so stellar service there, just keep in mind the poor staff have probably had to deal with come crazy stuff that day.

Yuck on that.\n\nThe next issue was that the gumbo was almost all rice and there wasn't much there.  Basically, the making of this dish was that they put a loaf of white bread in a bowl, skinned off a top layer of the bread, put a mound of rice on it and then dumped about 1\/2 cup (maybe a 1\/3 cup) of gumbo on top of it.  We left hungry and not satisfied at all.\n\nWe do have to say their french fries were really good (at $1.99).

My friends and the I ordered a to-go order to take to our hotel, but we also waited on line to go stay so we could order drinks and more food. \n\nListening to the hostess, Scott decided we shouldn't be seated although we waited in line, even though we assured him we were ordering more food and drinks. It took the on site sheriff to talk to him to understand what we were saying, as he was not listening to us at all. \n\nHe processed to go back and forth with us, then went in side. After the sherif explained to him once more, he decided to ask the hostess to sit us, but by his facial expression and tone. You can tell he was not pleased. I was completely disgusted.\n\nMy veggie burger was great and my friends enjoyed was great. I also ordered an old fashion with extra sugar, and it was great as well. \n\nI really wanted to leave Andr\u00e9 a nice tip for being so nice to us, but when I tried to use the ATM, I quickly found that there was no money in it. 2 workers directed me to it, but no one told me there was no money in the ATM. Afterwards when asking why the ATM didn't work, I was directed to go next door.\n\nInside, I ordered an old fashion and it was pretty good. My to go order was fine as well, but to be clear, I will never patronize a business with employees that act this way again. I will be sure to bring something back for Andr\u00e9. \n\nI enjoyed my veggie burger and my friends enjoyed their oysters. The food is good, but that service was terrible and embarrassing!","date":1606526542000}
